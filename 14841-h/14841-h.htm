      "My Dear Tom,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must again refer you to those two letters addressed to you at
      Passy before I read your speech in Galignani, &amp;amp;c., and
      which you do not seem to have received.<span class=

      "Of Hunt I see little&mdash;once a month or so, and then on his
      own business, generally. You may easily suppose that I know too
      little of Hampstead and his satellites to have much communion or
      community with him. My whole present relation to him arose from
      Shelley's unexpected wreck. You would not have had me leave him
      in the street with his family, would you? and as to the other
      plan you mention, you forget how it would <i>humiliate</i>
      him&mdash;that his writings should be supposed to be dead

      perhaps the vainest man on earth, at least his own friends say so
      pretty loudly; and if he were in other circumstances, I might be
      tempted to take him down a peg; but not now,&mdash;it would be
      cruel. It is a cursed business; but neither the motive nor the
      means rest upon my conscience, and it happens that he and his
      brother <i>have</i> been so far benefited by the publication in a
      pecuniary point of view. His brother is a steady, bold fellow,
      such as <i>Prynne</i>, for example, and full of moral, and, I
      hear, physical courage.

      Lord Byron had now, for some time, as may be collected from his
      letters, begun to fancy that his reputation in England was on the
      wane. The same thirst after fame, with the same sensitiveness to
      every passing change of popular favour, which led Tasso at last
      to look upon himself as the most despised of writers<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, had more than once disposed <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg003" id="pg003">003</a></span> Lord Byron,
      in the midst of all his triumphs, if not to doubt their reality,
      at least to distrust their continuance; and sometimes even, with
      that painful skill which sensibility supplies, to extract out of
      the brightest tributes of success some omen of future failure, or
      symptom of decline. New successes, however, still came to
      dissipate these bodings of diffidence; nor was it till after his
      unlucky coalition with Mr. Hunt in the Liberal, that any grounds
      for such a suspicion of his having declined in public favour
      showed themselves.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: In one of his letters this poet says:&mdash;"Non
        posso negare che io mi doglio oltramisura di esser stato tanto
        disprezzato dal mondo quanto non e altro scrittore di questo
        secolo." In another letter, however, after complaining of being
        "perseguitato da molti più che non era convenevole," he adds,
        with a proud prescience of his future fame, "Laondé stimo di
        poter mene ragionevolmente richiamare alla posterità."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The chief inducements, on the part of Lord Byron, to this
      unworthy alliance were, in the first place, a wish to second the
      kind views of his friend Shelley in inviting Mr. Hunt to join him
      in Italy; and, in the next, a desire to avail himself of the aid
      of one so experienced, as an editor, in the favourite project he
      had now so long contemplated, of a periodical work, in which all
      the various offspring of his genius might be received fast as
      they sprung to light. With such opinions, however, as he had long
      entertained of Mr. Hunt's character and talents<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, the facility with which he now admitted
      him&mdash;<i>not</i> certainly to any degree of confidence or
      intimacy, but to a declared fellowship of fame and interest in
      the eyes of the world, is, I own, an inconsistency not easily to
      be accounted for, and argued, at all events, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg004" id="pg004">004</a></span> a strong
      confidence in the antidotal power of his own name to resist the
      ridicule of such an association.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: See Letter 317. p. 103.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      As long as Shelley lived, the regard which Lord Byron entertained
      for him extended its influence also over his relations with his
      friend; the suavity and good-breeding of Shelley interposing a
      sort of softening medium in the way of those unpleasant
      collisions which afterwards took place, and which, from what is
      known of both parties, may be easily conceived to have been alike
      trying to the patience of the patron and the vanity of the
      dependent. That even, however, during the lifetime of their
      common friend, there had occurred some of those humiliating
      misunderstandings which money engenders,&mdash;humiliating on
      both sides, as if from the very nature of the dross that gives
      rise to them,&mdash;will appear from the following letter of
      Shelley's which I find among the papers in my hands.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      TO LORD BYRON.
    </h3>
    <p class="quotdate">
      "February 15. 1823.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lord Byron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I enclose you a letter from Hunt, which annoys me on more than
      one account. You will observe the postscript, and you know me
      well enough to feel how painful a task is set me in commenting
      upon it. Hunt had urged me more than once to ask you to lend him
      this money. My answer consisted in sending him all I could spare,
      which I have now literally done. Your kindness in fitting up a
      part of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg005" id=
      "pg005">005</a></span> your own house for his accommodation I
      sensibly felt, and willingly accepted from you on his part, but,
      believe me, without the slightest intention of imposing, or, if I
      could help it, allowing to be imposed, any heavier task on your
      purse. As it has come to this in spite of my exertions, I will
      not conceal from you the low ebb of my own money affairs in the
      present moment,&mdash;that is, my absolute incapacity of
      assisting Hunt farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think poor Hunt's promise to pay in a given time is
      worth very much; but mine is less subject to uncertainty, and I
      should be happy to be responsible for any engagement he may have
      proposed to you. I am so much annoyed by this subject that I
      hardly know what to write, and much less what to say; and I have
      need of all your indulgence in judging both my feelings and
      expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall see you by and by. Believe me
    </p>
    <p class="quotsig">
      "Yours most faithfully and sincerely,
      <br />
      "P.B. SHELLEY."
    <br />
    <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the book in which Mr. Hunt has thought it decent to revenge
      upon the dead the pain of those obligations he had, in his hour
      of need, accepted from the living, I am luckily saved from the
      distaste of speaking at any length, by the utter and most
      deserved oblivion into which his volume has fallen. Never,
      indeed, was the right feeling of the world upon such subjects
      more creditably displayed than in the reception given universally
      to that ungenerous book;&mdash;even those the least disposed to
      think approvingly of Lord Byron having shrunk back from such a
      corroboration <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg006" id=
      "pg006">006</a></span> of their own opinion as could be afforded
      by one who did not blush to derive his authority, as an accuser,
      from those facilities of observation which he had enjoyed by
      having been sheltered and fed under the very roof of the man whom
      he maligned.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the hostile feeling manifested in Mr. Hunt's work
      towards myself, the sole revenge I shall take is, to lay before
      my readers the passage in one of my letters which provoked it;
      and which may claim, at least, the merit of not being a covert
      attack, as throughout the whole of my remonstrances to Lord Byron
      on the subject of his new literary allies, not a line did I ever
      write respecting either Mr. Shelley or Mr. Hunt which I was not
      fully prepared, from long knowledge of my correspondent, to find
      that he had instantly, and as a matter of course, communicated to
      them. That this want of retention was a fault in my noble friend,
      I am not inclined to deny; but, being undisguised, it was easily
      guarded against, and, when guarded against, harmless. Besides,
      such is the penalty generally to be paid for frankness of
      character; and they who could have flattered themselves that one
      so open about his own affairs as Lord Byron would be much more
      discreet where the confidences of others were concerned, would
      have had their own imprudence, not his, to blame for any injury
      that their dependence upon his secrecy had brought on them.

      The following is the passage, which Lord Byron, as I take for
      granted, showed to Mr. Hunt, and to which one of his letters to
      myself (February 20.) refers:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg007" id="pg007">007</a></span>
      "I am most anxious to know that you mean to emerge out of the
      Liberal. It grieves me to urge any thing so much against Hunt's
      interest; but I should not hesitate to use the same language to
      himself, were I near him. I would, if I were you, serve him in
      every possible way but this&mdash;I would give him (if he would
      accept of it) the profits of the same works, published
      separately&mdash;but I would <i>not</i> mix myself up in this way
      with others. I would <i>not</i> become a partner in this sort of
      miscellaneous '<i>pot au feu</i>,' where the bad flavour of one
      ingredient is sure to taint all the rest. I would be, if I were
      <i>you</i>, alone, single-handed, and, as such, invincible."
    </p>
    <p>
      While on the subject of Mr. Hunt, I shall avail myself of the
      opportunity it affords me of introducing some portions of a
      letter addressed to a friend of that gentleman by Lord Byron, in
      consequence of an appeal made to the feelings of the latter on
      the score of his professed "friendship" for Mr. Hunt. The avowals
      he here makes are, I own, startling, and must be taken with more
      than the usual allowance, not only for the particular mood of
      temper or spirits in which the letter was written, but for the
      influence also of such slight casual piques and resentments as
      might have been, just then, in their darkening transit through
      his mind,&mdash;indisposing him, for the moment, to those among
      his friends whom, in a sunnier mood, he would have proclaimed as
      his most chosen and dearest.

      LETTER 509. TO MRS. &mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "I presume that you, at least, know enough of me to be sure that
      I could have no intention to insult Hunt's poverty. On the
      contrary, I honour him for it; for I know what it is, having been
      as much embarrassed as ever he was, without perceiving aught in
      it to diminish an honourable man's self-respect. If you mean to
      say that, had he been a wealthy man, I would have joined in this
      Journal, I answer in the negative. * * * I engaged in the Journal
      from good-will towards him, added to respect for his character,
      literary and personal; and no less for his political courage, as
      well as regret for his present circumstances: I did this in the
      hope that he might, with the same aid from literary friends of
      literary contributions (which is requisite for all journals of a
      mixed nature), render himself independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always treated him, in our personal intercourse, with
      such scrupulous delicacy, that I have forborne intruding advice
      which I thought might be disagreeable, lest he should impute it
      to what is called 'taking advantage of a man's situation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to friendship, it is a propensity in which my genius is very
      limited. I do not know the <i>male</i> human being, except Lord
      Clare, the friend of my infancy, for whom I feel any thing that
      deserves the name. All my others are men-of-the-world
      friendships. I did not even feel it for Shelley, however much I
      admired and esteemed him, so that you see not even vanity could
      bribe me into it, for, of all <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg009" id="pg009">009</a></span> men, Shelley thought highest of
      my talents,&mdash;and, perhaps, of my disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do my duty by my intimates, upon the principle of doing
      as you would be done by. I have done so, I trust, in most
      instances. I may be pleased with their conversation&mdash;rejoice
      in their success&mdash;be glad to do them service, or to receive
      their counsel and assistance in return. But as for friends and
      friendship, I have (as I already said) named the only remaining
      male for whom I feel any thing of the kind, excepting, perhaps,
      Thomas Moore. I have had, and may have still, a thousand friends,
      as they are called, in <i>life</i>, who are like one's partners
      in the waltz of this world&mdash;not much remembered when the
      ball is over, though very pleasant for the time. Habit, business,
      and companionship in pleasure or in pain, are links of a similar
      kind, and the same faith in politics is another." * * *

      "Mr. Hill is here: I dined with him on Saturday before last; and
      on leaving his house at S. P. d'Arena, my carriage broke down. I
      walked home, about three miles,&mdash;no very great feat of
      pedestrianism; but either the coming out of hot rooms into a
      bleak wind chilled me, or the walking up-hill to Albaro heated
      me, or something or other set me wrong, and next day I had an
      inflammatory attack in the face, to which I have been subject
      this winter for the first time, and I suffered a good deal of
      pain, but no peril. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg010" id=
      "pg010">010</a></span> My health is now much as usual. Mr. Hill
      is, I believe, occupied with his diplomacy. I shall give him your
      message when I see him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name, I see in the papers, has been dragged into the unhappy
      Portsmouth business, of which all that I know is very succinct.
      Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; is my solicitor. I found him so when I was
      ten years old&mdash;at my uncle's death&mdash;and he was
      continued in the management of my legal business. He asked me, by
      a civil epistle, as an old acquaintance of his family, to be
      present at the marriage of Miss H&mdash;&mdash;. I went very
      reluctantly, one misty morning (for I had been up at two balls
      all night), to witness the ceremony, which I could not very well
      refuse without affronting a man who had never offended me. I saw
      nothing particular in the marriage. Of course I could not know
      the preliminaries, except from what he said, not having been
      present at the wooing, nor after it, for I walked home, and they
      went into the country as soon as they had promised and vowed. Out
      of this simple fact I hear the Debats de Paris has quoted Miss H.
      as 'autrefois trés liée avec le célebre,' &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.
      I am obliged to him for the celebrity, but beg leave to decline
      the liaison, which is quite untrue; my liaison was with the
      father, in the unsentimental shape of long lawyers' bills,
      through the medium of which I have had to pay him ten or twelve
      thousand pounds within these few years. She was not pretty, and I
      suspect that the indefatigable Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; was (like all
      her people) more attracted by her title than her charms. I regret
      very much that I was present at the prologue to the happy
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg011" id="pg011">011</a></span>
      state of horse-whipping and black jobs, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.;
      but I could not foresee that a man was to turn out mad, who had
      gone about the world for fifty years, as competent to vote, and
      walk at large; nor did he seem to me more insane than any other
      person going to be married.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no objection to be acquainted with the Marquis
      Palavicini, if he wishes it. Lately I have gone little into
      society, English or foreign, for I had seen all that was worth
      seeing in the former before I left England, and at the time of
      life when I was more disposed to like it; and of the latter I had
      a sufficiency in the first few years of my residence in
      Switzerland, chiefly at Madame de Staël's, where I went
      sometimes, till I grew tired of <i>conversazioni</i> and
      carnivals, with their appendages; and the bore is, that if you go
      once, you are expected to be there daily, or rather nightly. I
      went the round of the most noted soirées at Venice or elsewhere
      (where I remained not any time) to the Benzona, and the Albrizzi,
      and the Michelli, &amp;c. &amp;c. and to the Cardinals and the
      various potentates of the Legation in Romagna, (that is,
      Ravenna,) and only receded for the sake of quiet when I came into
      Tuscany. Besides, if I go into society, I generally get, in the
      long run, into some scrape of some kind or other, which don't
      occur in my solitude. However, I am pretty well settled now, by
      time and temper, which is so far lucky, as it prevents
      restlessness; but, as I said before, as an acquaintance of yours,
      I will be ready and willing to know your friends. He may be a
      sort of connection for aught I know; for a Palavicini, of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg012" id="pg012">012</a></span>
      <i>Bologna</i>, I believe, married a distant relative of mine
      half a century ago. I happen to know the fact, as he and his
      spouse had an annuity of five hundred pounds on my uncle's
      property, which ceased at his demise; though I recollect hearing
      they attempted, naturally enough, to make it survive him. If I
      can do any thing for you here or elsewhere, pray order, and be
      obeyed."

    <p>
      "I have just seen some friends of yours, who paid me a visit
      yesterday, which, in honour of them and of you, I returned
      to-day;&mdash;as I reserve my bear-skin and teeth, and paws and
      claws, for our enemies.

    <p>
      "I have also seen Henry F&mdash;&mdash;, Lord H&mdash;&mdash;'s
      son, whom I had not looked upon since I left him a pretty, mild
      boy, without a neckcloth, in a jacket, and in delicate health,
      seven long years agone, at the period of mine eclipse&mdash;the
      third, I believe, as I have generally one every two or three
      years. I think that he has the softest and most amiable
      expression of countenance I ever saw, and manners correspondent.
      If to those he can add hereditary talents, he will keep the name
      of F&mdash;&mdash; in all its freshness for half a century more,
      I hope. I speak from a transient glimpse&mdash;but I love still
      to yield to such impressions; for I have ever found that those I
      liked longest and best, I took to at first sight; and I always
      liked that boy&mdash;perhaps, in part, from some resemblance in
      the less fortunate part of our destinies&mdash;I mean, to avoid
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg013" id="pg013">013</a></span>
      mistakes, his lameness. But there is this difference, that
      <i>he</i> appears a halting angel, who has tripped against a
      star; whilst I am <i>Le Diable Boiteux</i>,&mdash;a soubriquet,
      which I marvel that, amongst their various <i>nominis umbræ</i>,
      the Orthodox have not hit upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your other allies, whom I have found very agreeable personages,
      are Milor B&mdash;&mdash; and <i>épouse</i>, travelling with a
      very handsome companion, in the shape of a 'French Count' (to use
      Farquhar's phrase in the Beaux Stratagem), who has all the air of
      a <i>Cupidon déchainé,</i> and is one of the few specimens I have
      seen of our ideal of a Frenchman <i>before</i> the
      Revolution&mdash;an old friend with a new face, upon whose like I
      never thought that we should look again. Miladi seems highly
      literary,&mdash;to which, and your honour's acquaintance with the
      family, I attribute the pleasure of having seen them. She is also
      very pretty, even in a morning,&mdash;a species of beauty on
      which the sun of Italy does not shine so frequently as the
      chandelier. Certainly, English-women wear better than their
      continental neighbours of the same sex. M&mdash;&mdash; seems
      very good-natured, but is much tamed, since I recollect him in
      all the glory of gems and snuff-boxes, and uniforms, and
      theatricals, and speeches in our house&mdash;'I mean, of
      peers,'&mdash;(I must refer you to Pope&mdash;who you don't read
      and won't appreciate&mdash;for that quotation, which you must
      allow to be poetical,) and sitting to Stroeling, the painter, (do
      you remember our visit, with Leckie, to the German?) to be
      depicted as one of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg014" id=

      "I have been unwell&mdash;caught a cold and inflammation, which
      menaced a conflagration, after dining with our ambassador,
      Monsieur Hill,&mdash;not owing to the dinner, but my carriage
      broke down in the way home, and I had to walk some miles, up hill
      partly, after hot rooms, in a very bleak, windy evening, and
      over-hotted, or over-colded myself. I have not been so robustious
      as formerly, ever since the last summer, when I fell ill after a
      long swim in the Mediterranean, and have never been quite right
      up to this present writing. I am thin,&mdash;perhaps thinner than
      you saw me, when I was nearly transparent, in 1812,&mdash;and am
      obliged to be moderate of my mouth; which, nevertheless, won't
      prevent me (the gods willing) from dining with your friends the
      day after to-morrow.

      "They give me a very good account of you, and of your nearly
      'Emprisoned Angels.' But why did you change your title?&mdash;you
      will regret this some day. The bigots are not to be conciliated;
      and, if they were&mdash;are they worth it? I suspect that I am a
      more orthodox Christian than you are; and, whenever I see a real
      Christian, either in practice or in theory, (for I never yet
      found the man who could produce either, when put to the proof,) I
      am his disciple. But, till then, I cannot truckle to
      tithe-mongers,&mdash;nor can I imagine what has made <i>you</i>
      circumcise your Seraphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been far more persecuted than you, as you may judge by my
      present decadence,&mdash;for I <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg015" id="pg015">015</a></span> take it that I am as low in
      popularity and book-selling as any writer can be. At least, so my
      friends assure me&mdash;blessings on their benevolence! This they
      attribute to Hunt; but they are wrong&mdash;it must be, partly at
      least, owing to myself; be it so. As to Hunt, I prefer <i>not</i>
      having turned him to starve in the streets to any personal honour
      which might have accrued from such genuine philanthropy. I really
      act upon principle in this matter, for we have nothing much in
      common; and I cannot describe to you the despairing sensation of
      trying to do something for a man who seems incapable or unwilling
      to do any thing further for himself,&mdash;at least, to the
      purpose. It is like pulling a man out of a river who directly
      throws himself in again. For the last three or four years Shelley
      assisted, and had once actually extricated him. I have since his
      demise,&mdash;and even before,&mdash;done what I could: but it is
      not in my power to make this permanent. I want Hunt to return to
      England, for which I would furnish him with the means in comfort;
      and his situation <i>there</i>, on the whole, is bettered, by the
      payment of a portion of his debts, &amp;c.; and he would be on
      the spot to continue his Journal, or Journals, with his brother,
      who seems a sensible, plain, sturdy, and enduring person." * *

    <p>
      The new intimacy of which he here announces the commencement, and
      which it was gratifying to me, as the common friend of all, to
      find that he had formed, was a source of much pleasure to him
      during the stay of his noble acquaintances at Genoa. So long,
      indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg016" id=
      "pg016">016</a></span> had he persuaded himself that his
      countrymen abroad all regarded him in no other light than as an
      outlaw or a show, that every new instance he met of friendly
      reception from them was as much a surprise as pleasure to him;
      and it was evident that to his mind the revival of English
      associations and habitudes always brought with it a sense of
      refreshment, like that of inhaling his native air.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the view of inducing these friends to prolong their stay at
      Genoa, he suggested their taking a pretty villa called "Il
      Paradiso," in the neighbourhood of his own, and accompanied them
      to look at it. Upon that occasion it was that, on the lady
      expressing some intentions of residing there, he produced the
      following impromptu, which&mdash;but for the purpose of showing
      that he was not so "chary of his fame" as to fear failing in such
      trifles&mdash;I should have thought hardly worth transcribing.

    <p>
      "How is your gout? or rather, how are you? I return the Count
      &mdash;&mdash;'s Journal, which is a very extraordinary
      production<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and of a most
      melancholy truth in all that regards high life in England. I
      know, or knew personally, most of the personages and societies
      which he describes; and after reading his remarks, have the
      sensation fresh upon me as if I had seen them yesterday. I would
      however plead in behalf of some few exceptions, which I will
      mention by and by. The most singular thing is, <i>how</i> he
      should have penetrated <i>not</i> the <i>fact</i>, but the
      <i>mystery</i> of the English ennui, at two-and-twenty. I was
      about the same age when I made the same discovery, in almost
      precisely the same circles,&mdash;(for there is scarcely a person
      mentioned whom I did not see nightly or daily, and was acquainted
      more or less intimately with most of them,)&mdash;but I never
      could have described it so well. <i>Il faut étre Français</i>, to
      effect this.

      papers term it. He ought to have seen the gentlemen after dinner
      (on the hunting days), and the soiree ensuing
      thereupon,&mdash;and the women looking as if they had hunted, or
      rather been hunted; and I could have wished that he had been at a
      dinner in town, which I recollect at Lord
      C&mdash;&mdash;'s&mdash;small, but select, and composed of the
      most amusing people. The dessert was hardly on the table, when,
      out of twelve, I counted <i>five asleep;</i> of that five, there
      were <i>Tierney</i>, Lord &mdash;&mdash;, and Lord &mdash;&mdash;

      delighted with it, and says that she has derived a better notion
      of English society from it than from all Madame de Staël's
      metaphysical disputations on the same subject, in her work on the
      Revolution. I beg that you will thank the young philosopher, and

      "I am truly sorry that I cannot accompany you in your ride this
      morning, owing to a violent pain in my face, arising from a wart
      to which I by medical advice applied a caustic. Whether I put too
      much, I do not know, but the consequence is, that not only I have
      been put to some pain, but the peccant part and its immediate
      environ are as black as if the printer's devil had marked me for
      an author. As I do not wish to frighten your horses, or their
      riders, I shall postpone waiting upon you until six o'clock, when
      I hope to have subsided into a more christian-like resemblance to
      my fellow-creatures. My infliction has partially extended even to
      my fingers; for on trying to get the black from off my upper lip
      at least, I have only transfused a portion thereof to my right
      hand, and neither lemon-juice nor eau de Cologne, nor any other
      eau, have been able as yet to redeem it also from a more inky
      appearance than is either proper or pleasant. But 'out, damn'd
      spot'&mdash;you may have perceived something of the kind
      yesterday, for on my return, I saw that during my visit it had
      increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished; and I

      has succeeded since the days of Charles the Second and the

      During this period a circumstance occurred which shows, most
      favourably for the better tendencies of his nature, how much
      allayed and softened down his once angry feeling, upon the
      subject of his matrimonial differences, had now grown. It has
      been seen that his daughter Ada,&mdash;more especially since his
      late loss of the only tie of blood which he could <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg026" id="pg026">026</a></span> have a hope
      of attaching to himself,&mdash;had become the fond and constant
      object of his thoughts; and it was but natural, in a heart kindly
      as his was, that, dwelling thus with tenderness upon the child,
      he should find himself insensibly subdued into a gentler tone of
      feeling towards the mother. A gentleman, whose sister was known
      to be the confidential friend of Lady Byron, happening at this
      time to be at Genoa, and in the habit of visiting at the house of
      the poet's new intimates, Lord Byron took one day an opportunity,
      in conversing with Lady &mdash;&mdash;, to say, that she would
      render him an essential kindness if, through the mediation of
      this gentleman and his sister, she could procure for him from
      Lady Byron, what he had long been most anxious to possess, a copy
      of her picture. It having been represented to him, in the course
      of the same, or a similar conversation, that Lady Byron was said
      by her friends to be in a state of constant alarm lest he should
      come to England to claim his daughter, or, in some other way,
      interfere with her, he professed his readiness to give every
      assurance that might have the effect of calming such
      apprehensions; and the following letter, in reference to both
      these subjects, was soon after sent by him.

      have her plans carried into effect, both with regard to the
      education of the child, and the person or persons under whose
      care Lady B. might be desirous that she should be placed. It is
      not my intention to interfere with her in any way on the subject
      during her life; and I presume that it would be some consolation
      to her to know,(if she is in ill health, as I am given to
      understand,) that in <i>no</i> case would any thing be done, as
      far as I am concerned, but in strict conformity with Lady B.'s

      This negotiation, of which I know not the results, nor whether,
      indeed, it ever ended in any, led naturally and frequently to
      conversations on the subject of his marriage,&mdash;a topic he
      was himself always the first to turn to,&mdash;and the account
      which he then gave, as well of the circumstances of the
      separation, as of his own entire unconsciousness of the immediate
      causes that provoked it, was, I find, exactly such as, upon every
      occasion when the subject presented itself, he, with an air of
      sincerity in which it was <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg028"
      id="pg028">028</a></span> impossible not to confide, promulgated.
      "Of what really led to the separation (said he, in the course of
      one of these conversations,) I declare to you that, even at this
      moment, I am wholly ignorant; as Lady Byron would never assign
      her motives, and has refused to answer my letters. I have written
      to her repeatedly, and am still in the habit of doing so. Some of
      these letters I have sent, and others I did not, simply because I
      despaired of their doing any good. You may, however, see some of

      friends and foes have for seven years been throwing in the way of
      a man whose feelings were once quick, and whose temper was never
      patient. But 'returning were as tedious as go o'er.' I feel this
      as much as ever Macbeth did; and it is a dreary sensation, which
      at least avenges the real or imaginary wrongs of one of the two
      unfortunate persons whom it concerns."

      avoid society is, that I can never sleep after it, and the
      pleasanter it has been the less I rest."

    <h3>
      LETTER 518. TO LADY BYRON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (TO THE CARE OF THE HON. MRS. LEIGH, LONDON.)
    </p>
    <p class="quotdate">
      Pisa, November 17. 1821.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to acknowledge the receipt of 'Ada's hair,'which is very
      soft and pretty, and nearly as dark already as mine was at twelve
      years old, if I may judge from what I recollect of some in
      Augusta's possession, taken at that age. But it don't
      curl,&mdash;perhaps from its being let grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I also thank you for the inscription of the date and name, and I
      will tell you why;&mdash;I believe that they are the only two or
      three words of your handwriting in my possession. For your
      letters I returned, and except the two words, or rather the one
      word, 'Household,' written twice in an old account book, I have
      no other. I burnt your last note, for two reasons:&mdash;firstly,
      it was written in a style not very agreeable; and, secondly, I
      wished to take your word without documents, which are the worldly
      resources of suspicious people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that this note will reach you somewhere about Ada's
      birthday&mdash;the 10th of December, I believe. She will then be
      six, so that in about <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg031" id=
      "pg031">031</a></span> twelve more I shall have some chance of
      meeting her;&mdash;perhaps sooner, if I am obliged to go to
      England by business or otherwise. Recollect, however, one thing,
      either in distance or nearness;&mdash;every day which keeps us
      asunder should, after so long a period, rather soften our mutual
      feelings, which must always have one rallying-point as long as
      our child exists, which I presume we both hope will be long after
      either of her parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time which has elapsed since the separation has been
      considerably more than the whole brief period of our union, and
      the not much longer one of our prior acquaintance. We both made a
      bitter mistake; but now it is over, and irrevocably so. For, at
      thirty-three on my part, and a few years less on yours, though it
      is no very extended period of life, still it is one when the
      habits and thought are generally so formed as to admit of no
      modification; and as we could not agree when younger, we should
      with difficulty do so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say all this, because I own to you, that, notwithstanding every
      thing, I considered our re-union as not impossible for more than
      a year after the separation;&mdash;but then I gave up the hope
      entirely and for ever. But this very impossibility of re-union
      seems to me at least a reason why, on all the few points of
      discussion which can arise between us, we should preserve the
      courtesies of life, and as much of its kindness as people who are
      never to meet may preserve perhaps more easily than nearer
      connections. For my own part, I am violent, but not malignant;
      for only fresh provocations can awaken my resentments.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg032" id="pg032">032</a></span>
      To you, who are colder and more concentrated, I would just hint,
      that you may sometimes mistake the depth of a cold anger for
      dignity, and a worse feeling for duty. I assure you that I bear
      you <i>now</i> (whatever I may have done) no resentment whatever.
      Remember, that <i>if you have injured me</i> in aught, this
      forgiveness is something; and that, if I have <i>injured you</i>,
      it is something more still, if it be true, as the moralists say,
      that the most offending are the least forgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether the offence has been solely on my side, or reciprocal,
      or on yours chiefly, I have ceased to reflect upon any but two
      things,&mdash;viz. that you are the mother of my child, and that
      we shall never meet again. I think if you also consider the two
      corresponding points with reference to myself, it will be better
      for all three.

    <p>
      It has been my plan, as must have been observed, wherever my
      materials have furnished me with the means, to leave the subject
      of my Memoir to relate his own story; and this object, during the
      two or three years of his life just elapsed, I have been enabled
      by the rich resources in my hands, with but few interruptions, to
      attain. Having now, however, reached that point of his career
      from which a new start was about to be taken by his excursive
      spirit, and a course, glorious as it was brief and fatal, entered
      upon,&mdash;a moment of pause may be permitted while we look back
      through the last few years, and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg033" id="pg033">033</a></span> for a while dwell upon the
      spectacle, at once grand and painful, which his life during that
      most unbridled period of his powers exhibited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a state of unceasing excitement, both of heart and
      brain,&mdash;for ever warring with the world's will, yet living
      but in the world's breath,&mdash;with a genius taking upon itself
      all shapes, from Jove down to Scapin, and a disposition veering
      with equal facility to all points of the moral compass,&mdash;not
      even the ancient fancy of the existence of two souls within one
      bosom would seem at all adequately to account for the varieties,
      both of power and character, which the course of his conduct and
      writings during these few feverish years displayed. Without going
      back so far as the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold, which one of
      his bitterest and ablest assailants has pronounced to be, "in
      point of execution, the sublimest poetical achievement of mortal
      pen," we have, in a similar strain of strength and splendour, the
      Prophecy of Dante, Cain, the Mystery of Heaven and Earth,
      Sardanapalus,&mdash;all produced during this wonderful period of
      his genius. To these also are to be added four other dramatic
      pieces, which, though the least successful of his compositions,
      have yet, as Poems, few equals in our literature; while, in a
      more especial degree, they illustrate the versatility of taste
      and power so remarkable in him, as being founded, and to this
      very circumstance, perhaps, owing their failure, on a severe
      classic model, the most uncongenial to his own habits and
      temperament, and the most remote from that bold, unshackled
      license which it had been <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg034"
      id="pg034">034</a></span> the great mission of his genius,
      throughout the whole realms of Mind, to assert.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to all these high-toned strains, and struck off
      during the same fertile period, we find his Don Juan&mdash;in
      itself an epitome of all the marvellous contrarieties of his
      character&mdash;the Vision of Judgment, the Translation from
      Pulci, the Pamphlets on Pope, on the British Review, on
      Blackwood,&mdash;together with a swarm of other light, humorous
      trifles, all flashing forth carelessly from the same mind that
      was, almost at the same moment, personating, with a port worthy
      of such a presence, the mighty spirit of Dante, or following the
      dark footsteps of Scepticism over the ruins of past worlds, with
      Cain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, too, while occupied with these ideal creations,
      the demands upon his active sympathies, in real life, were such
      as almost any mind but his own would have found sufficient to
      engross its every thought and feeling. An amour, not of that
      light, transient kind which "goes without a burden," but, on the
      contrary, deep-rooted enough to endure to the close of his days,
      employed as restlessly with its first hopes and fears a portion
      of this period as with the entanglements to which it led,
      political and domestic, it embarrassed the remainder. Scarcely,
      indeed, had this disturbing passion begun to calm, when a new
      source of excitement presented itself in that conspiracy into
      which he flung himself so fearlessly, and which ended, as we have
      seen, but in multiplying the objects of his sympathy and
      protection, and driving him to a new change of home and scene.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg035" id="pg035">035</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we consider all these distractions that beset him, taking
      into account also the frequent derangement of his health, and the
      time and temper he must have thrown away on the minute drudgery
      of watching over every item of his household expenditure, the
      mind is lost in almost incredulous astonishment at the wonders he
      was able to achieve under such circumstances&mdash;at the variety
      and prodigality of power with which, in the midst of such
      interruptions and hinderances, his "bright soul broke out on
      every side," and not only held on its course, unclogged, through
      all these difficulties, but even extracted out of the very
      struggles and annoyances it encountered new nerve for its
      strength, and new fuel for its fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus at this period, more remarkably than at any other
      during his life, the unparalleled versatility of his genius was
      unfolding itself, those quick, cameleon-like changes of which his
      character, too, was capable were, during the same time, most
      vividly, and in strongest contrast, drawn out. To the world, and
      more especially to England,&mdash;the scene at once of his
      glories and his wrongs,&mdash;he presented himself in no other
      aspect than that of a stern, haughty misanthrope, self-banished
      from the fellowship of men, and, most of all, from that of
      Englishmen. The more genial and beautiful inspirations of his
      muse were, in this point of view, looked upon but as lucid
      intervals between the paroxysms of an inherent malignancy of
      nature; and even the laughing effusions of his wit and humour got
      credit for no other aim than that which Swift boasted of, as the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg036" id="pg036">036</a></span>
      end of all his own labours, "to vex the world rather than divert
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      How totally all this differed from the Byron of the social hour,
      they who lived in familiar intercourse with him may be safely
      left to tell. The sort of ferine reputation which he had acquired
      for himself abroad prevented numbers, of course, of his
      countrymen, whom he would have most cordially welcomed, from
      seeking his acquaintance. But, as it was, no English gentleman
      ever approached him, with the common forms of introduction, that
      did not come away at once surprised and charmed by the kind
      courtesy and facility of his manners, the unpretending play of
      his conversation, and, on a nearer intercourse, the frank,
      youthful spirits, to the flow of which he gave way with such a
      zest, as even to deceive some of those who best knew him into the
      impression, that gaiety was after all the true bent of his
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these contrasts which he presented, as viewed publicly and
      privately, is to be added also the fact, that, while braving the
      world's ban so boldly, and asserting man's right to think for
      himself with a freedom and even daringness unequalled, the
      original shyness of his nature never ceased to hang about him;
      and while at a distance he was regarded as a sort of autocrat in
      intellect, revelling in all the confidence of his own great
      powers, a somewhat nearer observation enabled a common
      acquaintance at Venice<span class="fnref">[1]</span> to
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg037" id="pg037">037</a></span>
      detect, under all this, traces of that self-distrust and
      bashfulness which had marked him as a boy, and which never
      entirely forsook him through the whole of his career.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: The Countess Albrizzi&mdash;see her Sketch of his
        Character.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Still more singular, however, than this contradiction between the
      public and private man,&mdash;a contradiction not unfrequent,
      and, in some cases, more apparent than real, as depending upon
      the relative position of the observer,&mdash;were those
      contrarieties and changes not less startling, which his character
      so often exhibited, as compared with itself. He who, at one
      moment, was seen intrenched in the most absolute self-will,
      would, at the very next, be found all that was docile and
      amenable. To-day, storming the world in its strong-holds, as a
      misanthrope and satirist&mdash;to-morrow, learning, with implicit
      obedience, to fold a shawl, as a Cavaliere&mdash;the same man who
      had so obstinately refused to surrender, either to friendly
      remonstrance or public outcry, a single line of Don Juan, at the
      mere request of a gentle Donna agreed to cease it altogether; nor
      would venture to resume this task (though the chief darling of
      his muse) till, with some difficulty, he had obtained leave from
      the same ascendant quarter. Who, indeed, is there that, without
      some previous clue to his transformations, could have been at all
      prepared to recognise the coarse libertine of Venice in that
      romantic and passionate lover who, but a few months after, stood
      weeping before the fountain in the garden at Bologna? or, who
      could have expected to find in the close calculator of sequins
      and baiocchi, that generous champion <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg038" id="pg038">038</a></span> of Liberty
      whose whole fortune, whose very life itself were considered by
      him but as trifling sacrifices for the advancement, but by a day,
      of her cause?
    </p>
    <p>
      And here naturally our attention is drawn to the consideration of
      another feature of his character, connected more intimately with
      the bright epoch of his life now before us. Notwithstanding his
      strongly marked prejudices in favour of rank and high birth, we
      have seen with what ardour,&mdash;not only in fancy and theory,
      bet practically, as in the case of the Italian
      Carbonari,&mdash;he embarked his sympathies unreservedly on the
      current of every popular movement towards freedom. Though of the
      sincerity of this zeal for liberty the seal set upon it so
      solemnly by his death leaves us no room to doubt, a question may
      fairly arise whether that general love of excitement, let it flow
      from whatever source it might, by which, more or less, every
      pursuit of his whole life was actuated, was not predominant among
      the impulses that governed him in this; and, again, whether it is
      not probable that, like Alfieri and other aristocratic lovers of
      freedom, he would not ultimately have shrunk from the result of
      his own equalising doctrines; and, though zealous enough in
      lowering those <i>above</i> his own level, rather recoil from the
      task of raising up those who were <i>below</i> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the first point, it may be conceded, without
      deducting much from his sincere zeal in the cause, that the
      gratification of his thirst of fame, and, above all, perhaps,
      that supply of excitement so necessary to him, to whet, as it
      were, the edge of his self-wearing spirit, were not the least of
      the attractions <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg039" id=
      "pg039">039</a></span> and incitements which a struggle under the
      banners of Freedom presented to him. It is also but too certain
      that, destined as he was to endless disenchantment, from that
      singular and painful union which existed in his nature of the
      creative imagination that calls up illusions, and the cool,
      searching sagacity that, at once, detects their hollowness, he
      could not long have gone on, even in a path so welcome to him,
      without finding the hopes with which his fancy had strewed it
      withering away beneath him at every step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In politics, as in every other pursuit, his ambition was to be
      among the first; nor would it have been from the want of a due
      appreciation of all that is noblest and most disinterested in
      patriotism, that he would ever have stooped his flight to any
      less worthy aim. The following passage in one of his Journals
      will be remembered by the reader:&mdash;"To be the first man
      <i>(not</i> the Dictator), not the Sylla, but the Washington, or
      Aristides, the leader in talent and truth, is to be next to the
      Divinity." With such high and pure notions of political eminence,
      he could not be otherwise than fastidious as to the means of
      attaining it; nor can it be doubted that with the sort of vulgar
      and sometimes sullied instruments which all popular leaders must
      stoop to employ, his love of truth, his sense of honour, his
      impatience of injustice, would have led him constantly into such
      collisions as must have ended in repulsion and disgust; while the
      companionship of those beneath him, a tax all demagogues must
      pay, would, as soon as it had ceased to amuse his fancy for the
      new and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg040" id=
      "pg040">040</a></span> ridiculous, have shocked his taste and
      mortified his pride. The distaste with which, as appears from
      more than one of his letters, he was disposed to view the
      personal, if not the political, attributes of what is commonly
      called the Radical party in England, shows how unsuited he was
      naturally to mix in that kind of popular fellowship which, even
      to those far less aristocratic in their notions and feelings,
      must be sufficiently trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, even granting that all these consequences might safely be
      predicted as almost certain to result from his engaging in such a
      career, it by no means the more necessarily follows that,
      <i>once</i> engaged, he would not have persevered in it
      consistently and devotedly to the last; nor that, even if reduced
      to say, with Cicero, "nil boni præter causam," he could not have
      so far abstracted the principle of the cause from its unworthy
      supporters as, at the same time, to uphold the one and despise
      the others. Looking back, indeed, from the advanced point where
      we are now arrived through the whole of his past career, we
      cannot fail to observe, pervading all its apparent changes and
      inconsistencies, an adherence to the original bias of his nature,
      a general consistency in the main, however shifting and
      contradictory the details, which had the effect of preserving,
      from first to last, all his views and principles, upon the great
      subjects that interested him through life, essentially
      unchanged.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Colonel Stanhope, who saw clearly this leading
        character of Byron's mind, has thus justly described
        it:&mdash;"Lord Byron's was a versatile and still a stubborn
        mind; it wavered, but always returned to certain fixed
        principles."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg041" id="pg041">041</a></span>At
      the worst, therefore, though allowing that, from disappointment
      or disgust, he might have been led to withdraw all personal
      participation in such a cause, in no case would he have shown
      himself a recreant to its principles; and though too proud to
      have ever descended, like Egalité, into the ranks of the people,
      he would have been far too consistent to pass, like Alfieri, into
      those of their enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the failure of those hopes with which he had so sanguinely
      looked forward to the issue of the late struggle between Italy
      and her rulers, it may be well conceived what a relief it was to
      him to turn his eyes to Greece, where a spirit was now rising
      such as he had himself imaged forth in dreams of song, but hardly
      could have even dreamed that he should live to see it realised.
      His early travels in that country had left a lasting impression
      on his mind; and whenever, as I have before remarked, his fancy
      for a roving life returned, it was to the regions about the "blue
      Olympus" he always fondly looked back. Since his adoption of
      Italy as a home, this propensity had in a great degree subsided.
      In addition to the sedatory effects of his new domestic r, there
      had, at this time, grown upon him a degree of inertness, or
      indisposition to change of residence, which, in the instance of
      his departure from Ravenna, was with some difficulty surmounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unsettled state of life he was from thenceforward thrown
      into, by the precarious fortunes of those with whom he had
      connected himself, conspired with one or two other causes to
      revive within him all his former love of change and adventure;
      nor is it wonderful <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg042" id=
      "pg042">042</a></span> that to Greece, as offering <i>both</i> in
      their most exciting form, he should turn eagerly his eyes, and at
      once kindle with a desire not only to witness, but perhaps share
      in, the present triumphs of Liberty on those very fields where he
      had already gathered for immortality such memorials of her day
      long past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the causes that concurred with this sentiment to determine
      him to the enterprise he now meditated, not the least powerful,
      undoubtedly, was the supposition in his own mind that the high
      tide of his poetical popularity had been for some time on the
      ebb. The utter failure of the Liberal,&mdash;in which, splendid
      as were some of his own contributions to it, there were yet
      others from his pen hardly to be distinguished from the
      surrounding dross,&mdash;confirmed him fully in the notion that
      he had at last wearied out his welcome with the world; and, as
      the voice of fame had become almost as necessary to him as the
      air he breathed, it was with a proud consciousness of the yet
      untouched reserves of power within him he now saw that, if
      arrived at the end of <i>one</i> path of fame, there were yet
      others for him to strike into, still more glorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      That some such vent for the resources of his mind had long been
      contemplated by him appears from a letter of his to myself, in
      which it will be recollected he says,&mdash;"If I live ten years
      longer, you will see that it is not over with me. I don't mean in
      literature, for that is nothing; and&mdash;it may seem odd enough
      to say&mdash;I do not think it was my vocation. But you will see
      that I shall do something,&mdash;the times and Fortune
      permitting,&mdash;that 'like the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg043" id="pg043">043</a></span> cosmogony of the world will
      puzzle the philosophers of all ages.'" He then adds this but too
      true and sad prognostic:&mdash;"But I doubt whether my
      constitution will hold out."
    </p>
    <p>
      His zeal in the cause of Italy, whose past history and literature
      seemed to call aloud for redress of her present vassalage and
      wrongs, would have, no doubt, led him to the same chivalrous
      self-devotion in her service, as he displayed afterwards in that
      of Greece. The disappointing issue, however, of that brief
      struggle is but too well known; and this sudden wreck of a cause
      so promising pained him the more deeply from his knowledge of
      some of the brave and true hearts embarked in it. The disgust,
      indeed, which that abortive effort left behind, coupled with the
      opinion he had early formed of the "hereditary bonds-men" of
      Greece, had kept him for some time in a state of considerable
      doubt and misgiving as to their chances of ever working out their
      own enfranchisement; nor was it till the spring of this year,
      when, rather by the continuance of the struggle than by its
      actual success, some confidence had begun to be inspired in the
      trust-worthiness of the cause, that he had nearly made up his
      mind to devote himself to its aid. The only difficulty that still
      remained to retard or embarrass this resolution was the necessity
      it imposed of a temporary separation from Madame Guiccioli, who
      was herself, as might be expected, anxious to participate his
      perils, but whom it was impossible he could think of exposing to
      the chances of a life, even for men, so rude.

      At the beginning of the month of April he received <span class=

      Mr. Blaquiere, who was then proceeding on a special mission to
      Greece, for the purpose of procuring for the Committee lately
      formed in London correct information as to the state and
      prospects of that country. It was among the instructions of this
      gentleman that he should touch at Genoa and communicate with Lord
      Byron; and the following note will show how cordially the noble
      poet was disposed to enter into all the objects of the Committee.

    <p>
      "Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be delighted to see you and your Greek friend, and the
      sooner the better. I have been expecting you for some
      time,&mdash;you will find me at home. I cannot express to you how
      much I feel interested in the cause, and nothing but the hopes I
      entertained of witnessing the liberation of Italy itself
      prevented me long ago from returning to do what little I could,
      as an individual, in that land which it is an honour even to have
      visited.

      LETTER 520. TO MR. BOWRING.
    </h3>
    <p class="quotdate">
      "Genoa, May 12. 1823
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have great pleasure in acknowledging your letter, and the
      honour which the Committee have <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg045" id="pg045">045</a></span> done me:&mdash;I shall
      endeavour to deserve their confidence by every means in my power.
      My first wish is to go up into the Levant in person, where I
      might be enabled to advance, if not the cause, at least the means
      of obtaining information which the Committee might be desirous of
      acting upon; and my former residence in the country, my
      familiarity with the Italian language, (which is there
      universally spoken, or at least to the same extent as French in
      the more polished parts of the Continent,) and my <i>not</i>
      total ignorance of the Romaic, would afford me some advantages of
      experience. To this project the only objection is of a domestic
      nature, and I shall try to get over it;&mdash;if I fail in this,
      I must do what I can where I am; but it will be always a source
      of regret to me, to think that I might perhaps have done more for
      the cause on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our last information of Captain Blaquiere is from Ancona, where
      he embarked with a fair wind for Corfu, on the 15th ult.; he is
      now probably at his destination. My last letter <i>from</i> him
      personally was dated Rome; he had been refused a passport through
      the Neapolitan territory, and returned to strike up through
      Romagna for Ancona:&mdash;little time, however, appears to have
      been lost by the delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The principal material wanted by the Greeks appears to be,
      first, a park of field artillery&mdash;light, and fit for
      mountain-service; secondly, gunpowder; thirdly, hospital or
      medical stores. The readiest mode of transmission is, I hear, by
      Idra, addressed to Mr. Negri, the minister. I meant to send up a
      certain quantity of the two latter&mdash;no great deal&mdash;but
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg046" id="pg046">046</a></span>
      enough for an individual to show his good wishes for the Greek
      success,&mdash;but am pausing, because, in case I should go
      myself, I can take them with me. I do not want to limit my own
      contribution to this merely, but more especially, if I can get to
      Greece myself, I should devote whatever resources I can muster of
      my own, to advancing the great object. I am in correspondence
      with Signor Nicolas Karrellas (well known to Mr. Hobhouse), who
      is now at Pisa; but his latest advice merely stated, that the
      Greeks are at present employed in organising their
      <i>internal</i> government, and the details of its
      administration: this would seem to indicate <i>security</i>, but
      the war is however far from being terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Turks are an obstinate race, as all former wars have proved
      them, and will return to the charge for years to come, even if
      beaten, as it is to be hoped they will be. But in no case can the
      labours of the Committee be said to be in vain; for in the event
      even of the Greeks being subdued, and dispersed, the funds which
      could be employed in succouring and gathering together the
      remnant, so as to alleviate in part their distresses, and enable
      them to find or make a country (as so many emigrants of other
      nations have been compelled to do), would 'bless both those who
      gave and those who took,' as the bounty both of justice and of
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With regard to the formation of a brigade, (which Mr. Hobhouse
      hints at in his short letter of this day's receipt, enclosing the
      one to which I have the honour to reply,) I would presume to
      suggest&mdash;but merely as an opinion, resulting rather from the
      melancholy <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg047" id=
      "pg047">047</a></span> experience of the brigades embarked in the
      Columbian service than from any experiment yet fairly tried in
      GREECE,&mdash;that the attention of the Committee had better
      perhaps be directed to the employment of <i>officers</i> of
      experience than the enrolment of <i>raw British</i> soldiers,
      which latter are apt to be unruly, and not very serviceable, in
      irregular warfare, by the side of foreigners. A small body of
      good officers, especially artillery; an engineer, with quantity
      (such as the Committee might deem requisite) of stores of the
      nature which Captain Blaquiere indicated as most wanted, would, I
      should conceive, be a highly useful accession. Officers, also,
      who had previously served in the Mediterranean would be
      preferable, as some knowledge of Italian is nearly indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would also be as well that they should be aware, that they
      are not going 'to rough it on a beef-steak and bottle of
      port,'&mdash;but that Greece&mdash;never, of late years, very
      plentifully stocked for a <i>mess</i>&mdash;is at present the
      country of all kinds of <i>privations</i>. This remark may seem
      superfluous; but I have been led to it, by observing that many
      <i>foreign</i> officers, Italian, French, and even Germans
      (but<i>fewer</i> of the <i>latter</i>), have returned in disgust,
      imagining either that they were going up to make a party of
      pleasure, or to enjoy full pay, speedy promotion, and a very
      moderate degree of duty. They complain, too, of having been ill
      received by the Government or inhabitants; but numbers of these
      complainants were mere adventurers, attracted by a hope of
      command and plunder, and disappointed of both. Those <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg048" id="pg048">048</a></span> Greeks I have
      seen strenuously deny the charge of inhospitality, and declare
      that they shared their pittance to the last crum with their
      foreign volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need not suggest to the Committee the very great advantage
      which must accrue to Great Britain from the success of the
      Greeks, and their probable commercial relations with England in
      consequence; because I feel persuaded that the first object of
      the Committee is their EMANCIPATION, without any interested
      views. But the consideration might weigh with the English people
      in general, in their present passion for every kind of
      speculation,&mdash;they need not cross the American seas, for one
      much better worth their while, and nearer home. The resources
      even for an emigrant population, in the Greek islands alone, are
      rarely to be paralleled; and the cheapness of every kind of, not
      <i>only necessary</i>, but <i>luxury</i>, (that is to say,
      <i>luxury</i> of <i>nature</i>,) fruits, wine, oil, &amp;c. in a
      state of peace, are far beyond those of the Cape, and Van
      Dieman's Land, and the other places of refuge, which the English
      people are searching for over the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg that the Committee will command me in any and every way.
      If I am favoured with any instructions, I shall endeavour to obey
      them to the letter, whether conformable to my own private opinion
      or not. I beg leave to add, personally, my respect for the
      gentleman whom I have the honour of addressing,
    </p>
    <p class="quotsig">

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg049" id=
      "pg049">049</a></span>"P.S. The best refutation of Gell will be
      the active exertions of the Committee;&mdash;I am too warm a
      controversialist; and I suspect that if Mr. Hobhouse have taken
      him in hand, there will be little occasion for me to 'encumber
      him with help.' If I go up into the country, I will endeavour to
      transmit as accurate and impartial an account as circumstances
      will permit.

    <p>
      "I shall write to Mr. Karrellas. I expect intelligence from
      Captain Blaquiere, who has promised me some early intimation from
      the seat of the Provisional Government. I gave him a letter of
      introduction to Lord Sydney Osborne, at Corfu; but as Lord S. is
      in the government service, of course his reception could only be
      a <i>cautious</i> one."

      "Sir,

    <p>
      "I received yesterday the letter of the Committee, dated the 14th
      of March. What has occasioned the delay, I know not. It was
      forwarded by Mr. Galignani, from Paris, who stated that he had
      only had it in his charge four days, and that it was delivered to
      him by a Mr. Grattan. I need hardly say that I gladly accede to
      the proposition of the Committee, and hold myself highly honoured
      by being deemed worthy to be a member. I have also to return my
      thanks, particularly to yourself, for the accompanying letter,
      which is extremely flattering. <span class="pagenum"><a name=

    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I last wrote to you, through the medium of Mr. Hobhouse, I
      have received and forwarded a letter from Captain Blaquiere to
      me, from Corfu, which will show how he gets on. Yesterday I fell
      in with two young Germans, survivors of General Normann's band.
      They arrived at Genoa in the most deplorable state&mdash;without
      food&mdash;without a soul&mdash;without shoes. The Austrians had
      sent them out of their territory on their landing at Trieste; and
      they had been forced to come down to Florence, and had travelled
      from Leghorn here, with four Tuscan <i>livres</i> (about three
      francs) in their pockets. I have given them twenty Genoese scudi
      (about a hundred and thirty-three livres, French money,) and new
      shoes, which will enable them to get to Switzerland, where they
      say that they have friends. All that they could raise in Genoa,
      besides, was thirty <i>sous</i>. They do not complain of the
      Greeks, but say that they have suffered more since their landing
      in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tried their veracity, 1st, by their passports and papers;
      2dly, by topography, cross-questioning them about Arta, Argos,
      Athens, Missolonghi, Corinth, c.; and, 3dly, in <i>Romaic</i>, of
      which I found one of them, at least, knew more than I do. One of
      them (they are both of good families) is a fine handsome young
      fellow of three-and-twenty&mdash;a Wirtembergher, and has a look
      of <i>Sandt</i> about him&mdash;the other a Bavarian, older and
      flat-faced, and less ideal, but a great, sturdy, soldier-like
      personage. The Wirtembergher was in the action at Arta, where the
      Philhellenists were cut to pieces after killing six hundred
      Turks, they themselves being only a hundred and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg051" id="pg051">051</a></span> fifty in
      number, opposed to about six or seven thousand; only eight
      escaped, and of them about three only survived; so that General
      Normann 'posted his ragamuffins where they were well
      peppered&mdash;not three of the hundred and fifty left
      alive&mdash;and they are for the town's end for life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "These two left Greece by the direction of the Greeks. When
      Churschid Pacha over-run the Morea, the Greeks seem to have
      behaved well, in wishing to save their allies, when they thought
      that the game was up with themselves. This was in September last
      (1822): they wandered from island to island, and got from Milo to
      Smyrna, where the French consul gave them a passport, and a
      charitable captain a passage to Ancona, whence they got to
      Trieste, and were turned back by the Austrians. They complain
      only of the minister (who has always been an indifferent
      character); say that the Greeks fight very well in their own way,
      but were at <i>first</i> afraid to <i>fire</i> their own
      cannon&mdash;but mended with practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adolphe (the younger) commanded at Navarino for a short time;
      the other, a more material person, 'the bold Bavarian in a
      luckless hour,' seems chiefly to lament a fast of three days at
      Argos, and the loss of twenty-five paras a day of pay in arrear,
      and some baggage at Tripolitza; but takes his wounds, and
      marches, and battles in very good part. Both are very simple,
      full of naïveté, and quite unpretending: they say the foreigners
      quarrelled among themselves, particularly the French with the
      Germans, which produced duels. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg052" id="pg052">052</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Greeks accept muskets, but throw away <i>bayonets</i>, and
      will <i>not</i> be disciplined. When these lads saw two
      Piedmontese regiments yesterday, they said, 'Ah! if we had but
      <i>these</i> two, we should have cleared the Morea:' in that case
      the Piedmontese must have behaved better than they did against
      the Austrians. They seem to lay great stress upon a few regular
      troops&mdash;say that the Greeks have arms and powder in plenty,
      but want victuals, hospital stores, and lint and linen, &amp;c.
      and money, very much. Altogether, it would be difficult to show
      more practical philosophy than this remnant of our 'puir hill
      folk' have done; they do not seem the least cast down, and their
      way of presenting themselves was as simple and natural as could
      be. They said, a Dane here had told them that an Englishman,
      friendly to the Greek cause, was here, and that, as they were
      reduced to beg their way home, they thought they might as well
      begin with me. I write in haste to snatch the post.

      "P.S. I have, since I wrote this, seen them again. Count P. Gamba
      asked them to breakfast. One of them means to publish his Journal
      of the campaign. The Bavarian wonders a little that the Greeks
      are not quite the same with them of the time of Themistocles,
      (they were not then very tractable, by the by,) and at the
      difficulty of disciplining them; but he is a 'bon homme' and a
      tactician, and a little like Dugald Dalgetty, who would insist
      upon the erection of 'a sconce on the hill of <span class=

      who was then at Rome, to request that he would accompany him.
      "You must have heard," he says, "that I am going to
      Greece&mdash;why do you not come to me? I can do nothing without
      you, and am exceedingly anxious to see you. Pray, come, for I am

      was ever contented in. I am serious; and did not write before, as
      I might have given you a journey for nothing. They all say I can
      be of use to Greece; I do not know how&mdash;nor do they; but, at
      all events, let us go."
    </p>
    <p>
      A physician, acquainted with surgery, being considered a
      necessary part of his suite, he requested of his own medical
      attendant at Genoa, Dr. Alexander, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg055" id="pg055">055</a></span> to provide him with such a
      person; and, on the recommendation of this gentleman, Dr. Bruno,
      a young man who had just left the university with considerable
      reputation, was engaged. Among other preparations for his
      expedition, he ordered three splendid helmets to be
      made,&mdash;with his never forgotten crest engraved upon
      them,&mdash;for himself and the two friends who were to accompany
      him. In this little circumstance, which in England (where the
      ridiculous is so much better understood than the heroic) excited
      some sneers at the time, we have one of the many instances that
      occur amusingly through his life, to confirm the quaint but, as
      applied to him, true observation, that "the child is father to
      the man;"&mdash;the characteristics of these two periods of life
      being in him so anomalously transposed, that while the passions
      and ripened views of the man developed themselves in his boyhood,
      so the easily pleased fancies and vanities of the boy were for
      ever breaking out among the most serious moments of his manhood.
      The same schoolboy whom we found, at the beginning of the first
      volume, boasting of his intention to raise, at some future time,
      a troop of horse in black armour, to be called Byron's Blacks,
      was now seen trying on with delight his fine crested helmet, and
      anticipating the deeds of glory he was to achieve under its
      plumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of May a letter arrived from Mr. Blaquiere
      communicating to him very favourable intelligence, and requesting
      that he would as much as possible hasten his departure, as he was
      now anxiously looked for, and would be of the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg056" id="pg056">056</a></span> greatest
      service. However encouraging this summons, and though Lord Byron,
      thus called upon from all sides, had now determined to give
      freely the aid which all deemed so essential, it is plain from
      his letters that, in the cool, sagacious view which he himself
      took of the whole subject, so far from agreeing with these
      enthusiasts in their high estimate of his personal services, he
      had not yet even been able to perceive any definite way in which
      those services could, with any prospect of permanent utility, be
      applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an insight into the true state of his mind at this crisis,
      the following observations of one who watched him with eyes
      quickened by anxiety will be found, perhaps, to afford the
      clearest and most certain clue. "At this time," says the Contessa
      Guiccioli, "Lord Byron again turned his thoughts to Greece; and,
      excited on every side by a thousand combining circumstances,
      found himself, almost before he had time to form a decision, or
      well know what he was doing, obliged to set out for that country.
      But, notwithstanding his affection for those
      regions,&mdash;notwithstanding the consciousness of his own moral
      energies, which made him say always that 'a man ought to do
      something more for society than write
      verses,'&mdash;notwithstanding the attraction which the object of
      this voyage must necessarily have for his noble mind, and that,
      moreover, he was resolved to return to Italy within a few
      months,&mdash;notwithstanding all this, every person who was near
      him at the time can bear witness to the struggle which his mind
      underwent (however much he endeavoured <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg057" id="pg057">057</a></span> to hide it),
      as the period fixed for his departure approached."<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: "Fu allora che Lord Byron rivolse i suoi pensieri
        alla Grecia; e stimolato poi da ogni parte per mille
        combinazioni egli si trovo quasi senza averlo deciso, e senza
        saperlo, obbligato di partire per la Grecia. Ma, non ostante il
        suo affetto per quelle contrade,&mdash;non ostante il
        sentimento delle sue forze morali che gli faceva dire sempre
        'che un uomo e obbligato a fare per la societa qualche cosa di
        piu che dei versi,&mdash;non ostante le attrative che doveva
        avere pel nobile suo animo l'oggetto di que viaggio,&mdash;e
        non ostante che egli fosse determinato di ritornare in Italia
        fra non molti mesi,&mdash;pure in quale combattimento si
        trovasse il suo cuore mentre si avvanzava l'epoca della sua
        parenza (sebbene cercasse occultarlo) ognuno che lo ha
        avvicinato allora puù dirlo."]

    <p>
      In addition to the vagueness which this want of any defined
      object so unsatisfactorily threw round the enterprise before him,
      he had also a sort of ominous presentiment&mdash;natural,
      perhaps, to one of his temperament under such
      circumstances&mdash;that he was but fulfilling his own doom in
      this expedition, and should die in Greece. On the evening before
      the departure of his friends, Lord and Lady B&mdash;&mdash;, from
      Genoa, he called upon them for the purpose of taking leave, and
      sat conversing for some time. He was evidently in low spirits,
      and after expressing his regret that they should leave Genoa
      before his own time of sailing, proceeded to speak of his
      intended voyage in a tone full of despondence. "Here," said he,
      "we are all now together&mdash;but when, and where, shall we meet
      again? I have a sort of boding that we see each other for the
      last time; as something tells me I shall never again return from
      Greece." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg058" id=
      "pg058">058</a></span> Having continued a little longer in this
      melancholy strain, he leaned his head upon the arm of the sofa on
      which they were seated, and, bursting into tears, wept for some
      minutes with uncontrollable feeling. Though he had been talking
      only with Lady B&mdash;&mdash;, all who were present in the room
      observed, and were affected by his emotion, while he himself,
      apparently ashamed of his weakness, endeavoured to turn off
      attention from it by some ironical remark, spoken with a sort of
      hysterical laugh, upon the effects of "nervousness."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, previous to this conversation, presented to each of the
      party some little farewell gift&mdash;a book to one, a print from
      his bust by Bartolini to another, and to Lady B&mdash;&mdash; a
      copy of his Armenian Grammar, which had some manuscript remarks
      of his own on the leaves. In now parting with her, having begged,
      as a memorial, some trifle which she had worn, the lady gave him
      one of her rings; in return for which he took a pin from his
      breast, containing a small cameo of Napoleon, which he said had
      long been his companion, and presented it to her Ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Lady B&mdash;&mdash; received from him the following
      note.

      instead of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg059" id=

      of so slight a value that you need not hesitate. As you wished
      for something <i>worn</i>, I can only say, that it has been worn
      oftener and longer than the other. It is of Venetian manufacture;
      and the only peculiarity about it is, that it could only be
      obtained at or from Venice. At Genoa they have none of the same
      kind. I also enclose a ring, which I would wish <i>Alfred</i> to
      keep; it is too large to <i>wear</i>; but is formed of
      <i>lava</i>, and so far adapted to the fire of his years and
      character. You will perhaps have the goodness to acknowledge the
      receipt of this note, and send back the pin (for good luck's
      sake), which I shall value much more for having been a night in
      your custody.

      In the mean time the preparations for his romantic expedition
      were in progress. With the aid of his banker and very sincere
      friend, Mr. Barry, of Genoa, he was enabled to raise the large
      sums of money necessary for his supply;&mdash;10,000 crowns in
      specie, and 40,000 crowns in bills of exchange, being the amount
      of what he took with him, and a portion of this having been
      raised upon his furniture and books, on which Mr. Barry, as I
      understand, advanced a sum far beyond their worth. An English
      brig, the Hercules, had been freighted to convey himself and his
      suite, which consisted, at this time, of Count Gamba, Mr.
      Trelawney, Dr. Bruno, and eight <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg060" id="pg060">060</a></span> domestics. There were also
      aboard five horses, sufficient arms and ammunition for the use of
      his own party, two one-pounders belonging to his schooner, the
      Bolivar, which he had left at Genoa, and medicine enough for the
      supply of a thousand men for a year.

      "We sail on the 12th for Greece.&mdash;I have had a letter from
      Mr, Blaquiere, too long for present transcription, but very
      satisfactory. The Greek Government expects me without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In conformity to the desires of Mr. B. and other correspondents
      in Greece, I have to suggest, with all deference to the
      Committee, that a remittance of even '<i>ten thousand pounds
      only</i>' (Mr. B.'s expression) would be of the greatest service
      to the Greek Government at present. I have also to recommend
      strongly the attempt of a loan, for which there will be offered a
      sufficient security by deputies now on their way to England. In
      the mean time, I hope that the Committee will be enabled to do
      something effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my own part, I mean to carry up, in cash or credits, above
      eight, and nearly nine thousand pounds sterling, which I am

      Of this sum I <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg061" id=

      subsistence of myself and suite; the rest I am willing to apply

      will not be misapplied to any individual speculation.

      "If I remain in Greece, which will mainly depend upon the
      presumed probable utility of my presence there, and of the
      opinion of the Greeks themselves as to its propriety&mdash;in
      short, if I am welcome to them, I shall continue, during my
      residence at least, to apply such portions of my income, present
      and future, as may forward the object&mdash;that is to say, what
      I can spare for that purpose. Privations I can, or at least could

      All was now ready; and on the 13th of July himself and his whole
      party slept on board the Hercules. About sunrise the next morning
      they succeeded in clearing the port; but there was little wind,
      and they remained in sight of Genoa the whole day. The night was
      a bright moonlight, but the wind had become stormy and adverse,
      and they were, for a short time, in serious danger. Lord Byron,
      who remained on deck during the storm, was employed anxiously,
      with the aid of such of his suite as were not disabled by
      sea-sickness from helping him in preventing further mischief to
      the horses, which, having been badly secured, had broken loose
      and injured each other. After making head against the wind for
      three or four hours, the captain was at last obliged to steer
      back to Genoa, and re-entered the port at six in the morning. On
      landing again, after this unpromising commencement of his voyage,
      Lord Byron (says Count Gamba) "appeared thoughtful, and remarked
      that he considered a bad beginning a favourable omen."
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been already, I believe, mentioned that, among the
      superstitions in which he chose to indulge, the supposed
      unluckiness of Friday, as a day for the commencement of any work,
      was one by which he, almost always, allowed himself to be
      influenced. Soon after his arrival at Pisa, a lady of his
      acquaintance happening to meet him on the road from her house as
      she was herself returning thither, and supposing <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg063" id="pg063">063</a></span> that he had
      been to make her a visit, requested that he would go back with
      her. "I have not been to your house," he answered; "for, just
      before I got to the door, I remembered that it was Friday; and,
      not liking to make my first visit on a Friday, I turned back." It
      is even related of him that he once sent away a Genoese tailor
      who brought him home a new coat on the same ominous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this, strange to say, he set sail for Greece on a
      Friday:&mdash;and though, by those who have any leaning to this
      superstitious fancy, the result maybe thought but too sadly
      confirmatory of the omen, it is plain that either the influence
      of the superstition over his own mind was slight, or, in the
      excitement of self-devotion under which he now acted, was
      forgotten, In truth, notwithstanding his encouraging speech to
      Count Gamba, the forewarning he now felt of his approaching doom
      seems to have been far too deep and serious to need the aid of
      any such accessory. Having expressed a wish, on relanding, to
      visit his own palace, which he had left to the care of Mr. Barry
      during his absence, and from which Madame Guiccioli had early
      that morning departed, he now proceeded thither, accompanied by
      Count Gamba alone. "His conversation," says this gentleman, "was
      somewhat melancholy on our way to Albaro: he spoke much of his
      past life, and of the uncertainty of the future. 'Where,' said
      he, 'shall we be in a year?'&mdash;It looked (adds his friend)
      like a melancholy foreboding; for, on the same day, of the same
      month, in the next year, he was carried to the tomb of his
      ancestors." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg064" id=
      "pg064">064</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It took nearly the whole of the day to repair the damages of
      their vessel; and the greater part of this interval was passed by
      Lord Byron, in company with Mr. Barry, at some gardens near the
      city. Here his conversation, as this gentleman informs me, took
      the same gloomy turn. That he had not fixed to go to England, in
      preference, seemed one of his deep regrets; and so hopeless were
      the views he expressed of the whole enterprise before him, that,
      as it appeared to Mr. Barry, nothing but a devoted sense of duty
      and honour could have determined him to persist in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of that day they set sail;&mdash;and now, fairly
      launched in the cause, and disengaged, as it were, from his
      former state of existence, the natural power of his spirit to
      shake off pressure, whether from within or without, began
      instantly to display itself. According to the report of one of
      his fellow-voyagers, though so clouded while on shore, no sooner
      did he find himself, once more, bounding over the waters, than
      all the light and life of his better nature shone forth. In the
      breeze that now bore him towards his beloved Greece, the voice of
      his youth seemed again to speak. Before the titles of hero, of
      benefactor, to which he now aspired, that of poet, however
      pre-eminent, faded into nothing. His love of freedom, his
      generosity, his thirst for the new and adventurous,&mdash;all
      were re-awakened; and even the bodings that still lingered at the
      bottom of his heart but made the course before him more precious
      from his consciousness of its brevity, and from the high
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg065" id="pg065">065</a></span>
      and self-ennobling resolution he had now taken to turn what yet
      remained of it gloriously to account.

      After a passage of five days, they reached Leghorn, at which

      It would have been the wish of Lord Byron, in the new path he had
      now marked out for himself, to disconnect from his name, if
      possible, all those poetical associations, which, by throwing a
      character of romance over the step he was now taking, might have
      a tendency, as he feared, to impair its practical utility; and it
      is, perhaps, hardly saying too much for his sincere zeal in the
      cause to assert, that he would willingly at this moment have
      sacrificed his whole fame, as poet, for even the prospect of an
      equivalent renown, as philanthropist and liberator. How vain,
      however, was the thought that he could thus supersede his own
      glory, or cause the fame of the lyre to be forgotten in that of
      the sword, was made manifest to him by a mark of homage which
      reached him, while at Leghorn, from the hands of one of the only
      two men of the age who could contend with him in the universality
      of his literary fame.

    <h3>
      "GOETHE AND BYRON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "The German poet, who, down to the latest period of his long
      life, had been always anxious to acknowledge the merits of his
      literary predecessors and contemporaries, because he has always
      considered this to be the surest means of cultivating his own
      powers, could not but have his attention attracted to the great
      talent of the noble Lord almost from his earliest appearance, and
      uninterruptedly watched the progress of his mind throughout the
      great works which he unceasingly produced. It was immediately
      perceived by him that the public appreciation of his poetical
      merits kept pace with the rapid succession of his writings. The
      joyful sympathy of others would have been perfect, had not the
      poet, by a life marked by self-dissatisfaction, and the
      indulgence of strong passions, disturbed the enjoyment which his
      infinite genius produced. But his German admirer was not led
      astray by this, or prevented from following with close attention
      both his works and his life in all their eccentricity. These
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg067" id="pg067">067</a></span>
      astonished him the more, as he found in the experience of past
      ages no element for the calculation of so eccentric an orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These endeavours of the German did not remain unknown to the
      Englishman, of which his poems contain unambiguous proofs; and he
      also availed himself of the means afforded by various travellers,
      to forward some friendly salutation to his unknown admirer. At
      length a manuscript Dedication of <i>Sardanapaius</i>, in the
      most complimentary terms, was forwarded to him, with an obliging
      enquiry whether it might be prefixed to the tragedy. The German,
      who, at his advanced age, was conscious of his own powers and of
      their effects, could only gratefully and modestly consider this
      Dedication as the expression of an inexhaustible intellect,
      deeply feeling and creating its own object. He was by no means
      dissatisfied when, after a long delay, Sardanapaius appeared
      without the Dedication; and was made happy by the possession of a
      fac-simile of it, engraved on stone, which he considered a
      precious memorial.

    <p>
      The noble Lord, however, did not abandon his purpose of
      proclaiming to the world his valued kindness towards his German
      contemporary and brother poet, a precious evidence of which was
      placed in front of the tragedy of Werner. It will be readily
      believed, when so unhoped for an honour was conferred upon the
      German poet,&mdash;one seldom experienced in life, and that too
      from one himself so highly distinguished,&mdash;he was by no
      means reluctant to express the high esteem and sympathising
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg068" id="pg068">068</a></span>
      sentiment with which his unsurpassed contemporary had inspired
      him. The task was difficult, and was found the more so, the more
      it was contemplated;&mdash;for what can be said of one whose
      unfathomable qualities are not to be reached by words? But when a
      young gentleman, Mr. Sterling, of pleasing person and excellent
      character, in the spring of 1823, on a journey from Genoa to
      Weimar, delivered a few lines under the hand of the great man as
      an introduction, and when the report was soon after spread that
      the noble Peer was about to direct his great mind and various
      power to deeds of sublime daring beyond the ocean, there appeared
      to be no time left for further delay, and the following lines
      were hastily written<span class="fnref">[1]</span>:&mdash;

      appeared, inaccessible. Driven back, however, by storms, he
      landed at Leghorn, where these cordial lines reached him just as
      he was about to embark, on the 24th of July, 1823. He had barely
      time to answer by a well-filled page, which the possessor has
      preserved among his most precious papers, as the worthiest
      evidence of the connection that had been formed. Affecting and
      delightful as was such a document, and justifying the most lively

      his country will at last recover from that violence of invective
      and reproach which has been so long raised against him, and will
      learn to understand that the dross and lees of the age and the
      individual, out of which even the best have to elevate
      themselves, are but perishable and transient, while the wonderful
      glory to which he in the present and through all future ages has
      elevated his country, will be as boundless in its splendour as it
      is incalculable in its consequences. Nor can there be any doubt
      that the nation, which can boast of so many great names, will
      class him among <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg070" id=

    <p>
      "Illustrious Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot thank you as you ought to be thanked for the lines
      which my young friend, Mr. Sterling, sent me of yours; and it
      would but ill become me to pretend to exchange verses with him
      who, for fifty years, has been the undisputed sovereign of
      European literature. You must therefore accept my most sincere
      acknowledgments in prose&mdash;and in hasty prose too; for I am
      at present on my voyage to Greece once more, and surrounded by
      hurry and bustle, which hardly allow a moment even to gratitude
      and admiration to express themselves.

      "I sailed from Genoa some days ago, was driven back by a gale of
      wind, and have since sailed again and arrived here, 'Leghorn,'
      this morning, to receive on board some Greek passengers for their
      struggling country.

    <p>
      "Here also I found your lines and Mr. Sterling's letter; and I

    <p class="quotsig">
      "Your obliged,
      <br />
      "NOEL BYRON."
    <br />
    <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      From Leghorn, where his Lordship was joined by Mr. Hamilton
      Browne, he set sail on the 24th of July, and, after about ten
      days of most favourable weather, cast anchor at Argostoli, the
      chief port of Cephalonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been thought expedient that Lord Byron should, with the
      view of informing himself correctly respecting Greece, direct his
      course, in the first instance, to one of the Ionian islands, from
      whence, as from a post of observation, he might be able to
      ascertain the exact position of affairs before he landed on the
      continent. For this purpose it had been recommended that either
      Zante or Cephalonia should be selected; and his choice was
      chiefly determined towards the latter island by his knowledge of
      the talents and liberal feelings of the Resident, Colonel Napier.
      Aware, however, that, in the yet doubtful aspect of the foreign
      policy of England, his arrival thus on an expedition so
      declaredly in aid of insurrection might have the effect of
      embarrassing the existing authorities, he resolved to adopt such
      a line of conduct as would be the least calculated either to
      compromise or offend them. It was with this view he now thought
      it prudent not to land at Argostoli, but to await on board his
      vessel such information <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg072" id=
      "pg072">072</a></span> from the Government of Greece as should
      enable him to decide upon his further movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of a person so celebrated at Argostoli excited
      naturally a lively sensation, as well among the Greeks as the
      English of that place; and the first approaches towards
      intercourse between the latter and their noble visiter were
      followed instantly, on both sides, by that sort of agreeable
      surprise which, from the false notions they had preconceived of
      each other, was to be expected. His countrymen, who, from the
      exaggerated stories they had so often heard of his misanthropy
      and especial horror of the English, expected their courtesies to
      be received with a haughty, if not insulting coldness, found, on
      the contrary, in all his demeanour a degree of open and cheerful
      affability which, calculated, as it was, to charm under any
      circumstances, was to them, expecting so much the reverse,
      peculiarly fascinating;&mdash;while he, on his side, even still
      more sensitively prepared, by a long course of brooding over his
      own fancies, for a cold and reluctant reception from his
      countrymen, found himself greeted at once with a welcome so
      cordial and respectful as not only surprised and flattered, but,
      it was evident, sensibly touched him. Among other hospitalities
      accepted by him was a dinner with the officers of the garrison,
      at which, on his health being drunk, he is reported to have said,
      in returning thanks, that "he was doubtful whether he could
      express his sense of the obligation as he ought, having been so
      long in the practice of speaking a foreign language <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg073" id="pg073">073</a></span> that it was
      with some difficulty he could convey the whole force of what he
      felt in his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having despatched messengers to Corfu and Missolonghi in quest of
      information, he resolved, while waiting their return, to employ
      his time in a journey to Ithaca, which island is separated from
      that of Cephalonia but by a narrow strait. On his way to Vathi,
      the chief city of the island, to which place he had been invited,
      and his journey hospitably facilitated, by the Resident, Captain
      Knox, he paid a visit to the mountain-cave in which, according to
      tradition, Ulysses deposited the presents of the Phæacians. "Lord
      Byron (says Count Gamba) ascended to the grotto, but the
      steepness and height prevented him from reaching the remains of
      the Castle. I myself experienced considerable difficulty in
      gaining it. Lord Byron sat reading in the grotto, but fell
      asleep. I awoke him on my return, and he said that I had
      interrupted dreams more pleasant than ever he had before in his
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though unchanged, since he first visited these regions, in his
      preference of the wild charms of Nature to all the classic
      associations of Art and History, he yet joined with much interest
      in any pilgrimage to those places which tradition had sanctified.
      At the Fountain of Arethusa, one of the spots of this kind which
      he visited, a repast had been prepared for himself and his party
      by the Resident; and at the School of Homer,&mdash;as some
      remains beyond Chioni are called,&mdash;he met with an old
      refugee bishop, whom he had known thirteen years before in
      Livadia, and with whom he now <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg074" id="pg074">074</a></span> conversed of those times, with
      a rapidity and freshness of recollection with which the memory of
      the old bishop could but ill keep pace. Neither did the
      traditional Baths of Penelope escape his research; and "however
      sceptical (says a lady, who, soon after, followed his footsteps,)
      he might have been as to these supposed localities, he never
      offended the natives by any objection to the reality of their
      fancies. On the contrary, his politeness and kindness won the
      respect and admiration of all those Greek gentlemen who saw him;
      and to me they spoke of him with enthusiasm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those benevolent views by which, even more, perhaps, than by any
      ambition of renown, he proved himself to be actuated in his
      present course, had, during his short stay at Ithaca,
      opportunities of disclosing themselves. On learning that a number
      of poor families had fled thither from Scio, Patras, and other
      parts of Greece, he not only presented to the Commandant three
      thousand piastres for their relief, but by his generosity to one
      family in particular, which had once been in a state of affluence
      at Patras, enabled them to repair their circumstances and again
      live in comfort. "The eldest girl (says the lady whom I have
      already quoted) became afterwards the mistress of the school
      formed at Ithaca; and neither she, her sister, nor mother, could
      ever speak of Lord Byron without the deepest feeling of
      gratitude, and of regret for his too premature death."
    </p>
    <p>
      After occupying in this excursion about eight days, he had again
      established himself on board the Hercules, when one of the
      messengers whom he had <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg075" id=
      "pg075">075</a></span> despatched returned, bringing a letter to
      him from the brave Marco Botzari, whom he had left among the
      mountains of Agrafa, preparing for that attack in which he so
      gloriously fell. The following are the terms in which this heroic
      chief wrote to Lord Byron:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your letter, and that of the venerable Ignazio, have filled me
      with joy. Your Excellency is exactly the person of whom we stand
      in need. Let nothing prevent you from coming into this part of
      Greece. The enemy threatens us in great number; but, by the help
      of God and your Excellency, they shall meet a suitable
      resistance. I shall have something to do to-night against a corps
      of six or seven thousand Albanians, encamped close to this place.
      The day after to-morrow I will set out with a few chosen
      companions, to meet your Excellency. Do not delay. I thank you
      for the good opinion you have of my fellow-citizens, which God
      grant you will not find ill-founded; and I thank you still more
      for the care you have so kindly taken of them.
    </p>
    <p class="quotsig">
      "Believe me," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the expectation that Lord Byron would proceed forthwith to
      Missolonghi, it had been the intention of Botzari, as the above
      letter announces, to leave the army, and hasten, with a few of
      his brother warriors, to receive their noble ally on his landing
      in a manner worthy of the generous mission on which he came. The
      above letter, however, preceded but by a few hours his death.
      That very night he penetrated, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg076" id="pg076">076</a></span> with but a handful of
      followers, into the midst of the enemy's camp, whose force was
      eight thousand strong, and after leading his heroic band over
      heaps of dead, fell, at last, close to the tent of the Pasha
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mention made in this brave Suliote's letter of Lord Byron's
      care of his fellow-citizens refers to a popular act done recently
      by the noble poet at Cephalonia, in taking into his pay, as a
      body-guard, forty of this now homeless tribe. On finding,
      however, that for want of employment they were becoming restless
      and turbulent, he despatched them off soon after, armed and
      provisioned, to join in the defence of Missolonghi, which was at
      that time besieged on one side by a considerable force, and
      blockaded on the other by a Turkish squadron. Already had he,
      with a view to the succour of this place, made a generous offer
      to the Government, which he thus states himself in one of his
      letters:&mdash;"I offered to advance a thousand dollars a month
      for the succour of Missolonghi, and the Suliotes under Botzari
      (since killed); but the Government have answered me, that they
      wish to confer with me previously, which is in fact saying they
      wish me to expend my money in some other direction. I will take
      care that it is for the public cause, otherwise I will not
      advance a para. The opposition say they want to cajole me, and
      the party in power say the others wish to seduce me, so between
      the two I have a difficult part to play; however, I will have
      nothing to do with the factions unless to reconcile them if
      possible." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg077" id=
      "pg077">077</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In these last few sentences is described briefly the position in
      which Lord Byron was now placed, and in which the coolness,
      foresight, and self-possession he displayed sufficiently refute
      the notion that even the highest powers of imagination, whatever
      effect they may sometimes produce on the moral temperament, are
      at all incompatible with the sound practical good sense, the
      steadily balanced views, which the business of active life
      requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great difficulty, to an observer of the state of Greece at
      this crisis, was to be able clearly to distinguish between what
      was real and what was merely apparent in those tests by which the
      probability of her future success or failure was to be judged.
      With a Government little more than nominal, having neither
      authority nor resources, its executive and legislative branches
      being openly at variance, and the supplies that ought to fill its
      exchequer being intercepted by the military Chiefs, who, as they
      were, in most places, collectors of the revenue, were able to rob
      by authority;&mdash;with that curse of all popular enterprises, a
      multiplicity of leaders, each selfishly pursuing his own objects,
      and ready to make the sword the umpire of their
      claims;&mdash;with a fleet furnished by private adventure, and
      therefore precarious; and an army belonging rather to its Chiefs
      than to the Government, and, accordingly, trusting more to
      plunder than to pay;&mdash;with all these principles of mischief,
      and, as it would seem, ruin at the very heart of the struggle, it
      had yet persevered, which was in itself victory, through three
      trying campaigns; and at this moment presented, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg078" id="pg078">078</a></span> in the midst
      of all its apparent weakness and distraction, some elements of
      success which both accounted for what had hitherto been effected,
      and gave a hope, with more favouring circumstances, of something
      nobler yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the never-failing encouragement which the incapacity of
      their enemies afforded them, the Greeks derived also from the
      geographical conformation of their country those same advantages
      with which nature had blessed their great ancestors, and which
      had contributed mainly perhaps to the formation, as well as
      maintenance, of their high national character. Islanders and
      mountaineers, they were, by their very position, heirs to the
      blessings of freedom and commerce; nor had the spirit of either,
      through all their long slavery and sufferings, ever wholly died
      away. They had also, luckily, in a political as well as religious
      point of view, preserved that sacred line of distinction between
      themselves and their conquerors which a fond fidelity to an
      ancient church could alone have maintained for
      them;&mdash;keeping thus holily in reserve, against the hour of
      struggle, that most stirring of all the excitements to which
      Freedom can appeal when she points to her flame rising out of the
      censer of Religion. In addition to these, and all the other moral
      advantages included in them, for which the Greeks were indebted
      to their own nature and position, is to be taken also into
      account the aid and sympathy they had every right to expect from
      others, as soon as their exertions in their own cause should
      justify the confidence that it would be something <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg079" id="pg079">079</a></span> more than the
      mere chivalry of generosity to assist them.<span class=

      Such seem to have been the chief features of hope which the state
      of Greece, at this moment, presented. But though giving promise,
      perhaps, of a lengthened continuance of the struggle, they, in
      that very promise, postponed indefinitely the period of its
      success; and checked and counteracted as were these auspicious
      appearances by the manifold and inherent evils above
      enumerated,&mdash;by a consideration, too, of the resources and
      obstinacy of the still powerful Turk, and of the little favour
      with which it was at all probable that the Courts of Europe would
      ever regard the attempt of any people, under any circumstances,
      to be their own emancipators,&mdash;none, assuredly, but a most
      sanguine spirit could indulge in the dream that Greece would be
      able to work out her own liberation, or that aught, indeed, but a
      fortuitous concurrence of political circumstances could ever
      accomplish it. Like many other such contests between right and
      might, it was a cause destined, all felt, to be successful, but
      at its own ripe hour;&mdash;a cause which individuals might keep
      alive, but which events, wholly independent of them, alone could
      accomplish, and which, after the hearts, and hopes, and lives of
      all its bravest defenders had been wasted upon it, would at last
      to other hands, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg080" id=

      That Lord Byron, on a nearer view of the state of Greece, saw it
      much in the light I have here regarded it in, his letters leave
      no room to doubt. Neither was the impression he had early
      received of the Greeks themselves at all improved by the present
      renewal of his acquaintance with them. Though making full
      allowance for the causes that had produced their degeneracy, he
      still saw that they were grossly degenerate, and must be dealt
      with and counted upon accordingly. "I am of St. Paul's opinion,"
      said he, "that there is no difference between Jews and
      Greeks,&mdash;the character of both being equally vile." With
      such means and materials, the work of regeneration, he knew, must
      be slow; and the hopelessness he therefore felt as to the chances
      of ever connecting his name with any essential or permanent
      benefit to Greece, gives to the sacrifice he now made of himself
      a far more touching interest than had the consciousness of dying
      for some great object been at once his incitement and reward. He
      but looked upon himself,&mdash;to use a favourite illustration of
      his own,&mdash;as one of the many waves that must break and die
      upon the shore, before the tide they help to advance can reach
      its full mark. "What signifies Self," was his generous thought,
      "if a single spark of that which would be worthy of the past can
      be bequeathed unquenchedly to the future?"<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> Such <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg081" id=
      "pg081">081</a></span> was the devoted feeling with which he
      embarked in the cause of Italy; and these words, which, had they
      remained <i>only</i> words, the unjust world would have
      pronounced but an idle boast, have now received from his whole
      course in Greece a practical comment, which gives them all the
      right of truth to be engraved solemnly on his tomb.

        taken by him also on that occasion:&mdash;"I shall not," he

      Though with so little hope of being able to serve signally the
      cause, the task of at least lightening, by his interposition,
      some of the manifold mischiefs that pressed upon it, might yet,
      he thought, be within his reach. To convince the Government and
      the Chiefs of the paralysing effect of their
      dissensions;&mdash;to inculcate that spirit of union among
      themselves which alone could give strength against their
      enemies;&mdash;to endeavour to humanise the feelings of the
      belligerents on both sides, so as to take from the war that
      character of barbarism which deterred the more civilised friends
      of freedom through Europe from joining in it;&mdash;such were, in
      addition to the now essential aid of his money, the great objects
      which he proposed to effect by his interference; and to these he
      accordingly, with all the candour, clear-sightedness, and courage
      which so pre-eminently distinguished his great mind, applied
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware that, to judge deliberately of the state of parties, he
      must keep out of their vortex, and warned, by the very impatience
      and rivalry with which the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg082"
      id="pg082">082</a></span> different chiefs courted his presence,
      of the risk he should run by connecting himself with any, he
      resolved to remain, for some time longer, in his station at
      Cephalonia, and there avail himself of the facilities afforded by
      the position for collecting information as to the real state of
      affairs, and ascertaining in what quarter his own presence and
      money would be most available. During the six weeks that had
      elapsed since his arrival at Cephalonia, he had been living in
      the most comfortless manner, pent up with pigs and poultry, on
      board the vessel which brought him. Having now come, however, to
      the determination of prolonging his stay, he decided also upon
      fixing his abode on shore; and, for the sake of privacy, retired
      to a small village, called Metaxata, about seven miles from
      Argostoli, where he continued to reside during the remainder of
      his stay on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this change of residence, he had despatched Mr. Hamilton
      Browne and Mr. Trelawney with a letter to the existing Government
      of Greece, explanatory of his own views and those of the
      Committee whom he represented; and it was not till a month after
      his removal to Metaxata that intelligence from these gentlemen
      reached him. The picture they gave of the state of the country
      was, in most respects, confirmatory of what has already been
      described as his own view of it;&mdash;incapacity and selfishness
      at the head of affairs, disorganisation throughout the whole body
      politic, but still, with all this, the heart of the nation sound,
      and bent on resistance. Nor could he have failed to be struck
      with <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg083" id=
      "pg083">083</a></span> the close family resemblance to the
      ancient race of the country which this picture
      exhibited;&mdash;that great people, in the very midst of their
      own endless dissensions, having been ever ready to face round in
      concert against the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship's agents had been received with all due welcome by
      the Government, who were most desirous that he should set out for
      the Morea without delay; and pressing letters to the same
      purport, both from the Legislative and Executive bodies,
      accompanied those which reached him from Messrs. Browne and
      Trelawney. He was, however, determined not to move till his own
      selected time, having seen reason, the farther insight he
      obtained into their intrigues, to congratulate himself but the
      more on his prudence in not plunging into the maze without being
      first furnished with those guards against deception which the
      information he was now acquiring supplied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give an idea, as briefly as possible, of the sort of
      conflicting calls that were from various scenes of action,
      reaching him in his retirement, it may be sufficient to mention
      that, while by Metaxa, the present governor of Missolonghi, he
      was entreated earnestly to hasten to the relief of that place,
      which the Turks were now blockading both by land and by sea, the
      head of the military chiefs, Colocotroni, was no less earnestly
      urging that he should present himself at the approaching congress
      of Salamis, where, under the dictation of these rude warriors,
      the affairs of the country were to be settled,&mdash;while at the
      same time, from another quarter, the great opponent of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg084" id="pg084">084</a></span>
      these chieftains, Mavrocordato, was, with more urgency, as well
      as more ability than any, endeavouring to impress upon him his
      own views, and imploring his presence at Hydra, whither he
      himself had just been forced to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere knowledge, indeed, that a noble Englishman had arrived
      in those regions, so unprepossessed by any party as to inspire a
      hope of his alliance in all, and with money, by common rumour, as
      abundant as the imaginations of the needy chose to make it, was,
      in itself, fully sufficient, without any of the more elevated
      claims of his name, to attract towards him all thoughts. "It is
      easier to conceive," says Count Gamba, "than to relate the
      various means employed to engage him in one faction or the other:
      letters, messengers, intrigues, and recriminations,&mdash;nay,
      each faction had its agents exerting every art to degrade its
      opponent." He then adds a circumstance strongly illustrative of a
      peculiar feature in the noble poet's character:&mdash;"He
      occupied himself in discovering the truth, hidden as it was under
      these intrigues, and <i>amused himself in confronting the agents
      of the different factions."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      During all these occupations he went on pursuing his usual simple
      and uniform course of life,&mdash;rising, however, for the
      despatch of business, at an early hour, which showed how capable
      he was of conquering even long habit when necessary. Though so
      much occupied, too, he was, at all hours, accessible to visitors;
      and the facility with which he allowed even the dullest people to
      break in upon him was exemplified, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg085" id="pg085">085</a></span> I am told, strongly in the case
      of one of the officers of the garrison, who, without being able
      to understand any thing of the poet but his good-nature, used to
      say, whenever he found his time hang heavily on his
      hands,&mdash;"I think I shall ride out and have a little talk
      with Lord Byron."
    </p>
    <p>
      The person, however, whose visits appeared to give him most
      pleasure, as well from the interest he took in the subject on
      which they chiefly conversed, as from the opportunities,
      sometimes, of pleasantry which the peculiarities of his visiter
      afforded him, was a medical gentleman named Kennedy, who, from a
      strong sense of the value of religion to himself, had taken up
      the benevolent task of communicating his own light to others. The
      first origin of their intercourse was an undertaking, on the part
      of this gentleman, to convert to a firm belief in Christianity
      some rather sceptical friends of his, then at Argostoli.
      Happening to hear of the meeting appointed for this purpose, Lord
      Byron begged that he might be allowed to attend, saying to the
      person through whom he conveyed his request, "You know I am
      reckoned a black sheep,&mdash;yet, after all, not so black as the
      world believes me." He had promised to convince Dr. Kennedy that,
      "though wanting, perhaps, in faith, he at least had patience:"
      but the process of so many hours of lecture,&mdash;no less than
      twelve, without interruption, being stipulated for,&mdash;was a
      trial beyond his strength; and, very early in the operation, as
      the Doctor informs us, he began to show evident signs of a wish
      to exchange the part of hearer for that of speaker.
      Notwithstanding <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg086" id=
      "pg086">086</a></span> this, however, there was in all his
      deportment, both as listener and talker, such a degree of
      courtesy, candour, and sincere readiness to be taught, as excited
      interest, if not hope, for his future welfare in the good Doctor;
      and though he never after attended the more numerous meetings,
      his conferences, on the same subject, with Dr. Kennedy alone,
      were not infrequent during the remainder of his stay at
      Cephalonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      These curious conversations are now published; and to the value
      which they possess as a simple and popular exposition of the
      chief evidences of Christianity, is added the charm that must
      ever dwell round the character of one of the interlocutors, and
      the almost fearful interest attached to every word that, on such
      a subject, he utters. In the course of the first conversation, it
      will be seen that Lord Byron expressly disclaimed being one of
      those infidels "who deny the Scriptures, and wish to remain in
      unbelief." On the contrary, he professed himself "desirous to
      believe; as he experienced no happiness in having his religious
      opinions so unfixed." He was unable, however, he added, "to
      understand the Scriptures. Those who conscientiously believed
      them he could always respect, and was always disposed to trust in
      them more than in others; but he had met with so many whose
      conduct differed from the principles which they professed, and
      who seemed to profess those principles either because they were
      paid to do so, or from some other motive which an intimate
      acquaintance with their character would enable one to detect,
      that altogether he had seen <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg087"
      id="pg087">087</a></span> few, if any, whom he could rely upon as
      truly and conscientiously believing the Scriptures."
    </p>
    <p>
      We may take for granted that these Conversations,&mdash;more
      especially the first, from the number of persons present who
      would report the proceedings,&mdash;excited considerable interest
      among the society of Argostoli. It was said that Lord Byron had
      displayed such a profound knowledge of the Scriptures as
      astonished, and even puzzled, the polemic Doctor; while in all
      the eminent writers on theological subjects he had shown himself
      far better versed than his more pretending opponent. All this Dr.
      Kennedy strongly denies; and the truth seems to be, that on
      neither side were there much stores of theological learning. The
      confession of the lecturer himself, that he had not read the
      works of Stillingfleet or Barrow, shows that, in his researches
      after orthodoxy, he had not allowed himself any very extensive
      range; while the alleged familiarity of Lord Byron with the same
      authorities must be taken with a similar abatement of credence
      and wonder to that which his own account of his youthful studies,
      already given, requires;&mdash;a rapid eye and retentive memory
      having enabled him, on this as on most other subjects, to catch,
      as it were, the salient points on the surface of knowledge, and
      the recollections he thus gathered being, perhaps, the livelier
      from his not having encumbered himself with more. To any regular
      train of reasoning, even on this his most favourite topic, it was
      not possible to lead him. He would start objections to the
      arguments of others, and detect their fallacies; but of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg088" id="pg088">088</a></span>
      any consecutive ratiocination on his own side he seemed, if not
      incapable, impatient. In this, indeed, as in many other
      peculiarities belonging to him,&mdash;his caprices, fits of
      weeping, sudden affections and dislikes,&mdash;may be observed
      striking traces of a feminine cast of character;&mdash;it being
      observable that the discursive faculty is rarely exercised by
      women; but that nevertheless, by the mere instinct of truth (as
      was the case with Lord Byron), they are often enabled at once to
      light upon the very conclusion to which man, through all the
      forms of reasoning, is, in the mean time, puzzling, and, perhaps,
      losing his way:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "And strikes each point with native force of mind,
      </p>
      <p>
        While puzzled logic blunders far behind."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Of the Scriptures, it is certain that Lord Byron was a frequent
      and almost daily reader,&mdash;the small pocket Bible which, on
      his leaving England, had been given him by his sister, being
      always near him. How much, in addition to his natural solicitude
      on the subject of religion, the taste of the poet influenced him
      in this line of study, may be seen in his frequently expressed
      admiration of "the ghost-scene," as he called it, in Samuel, and
      his comparison of this supernatural appearance with the
      Mephistopheles of Goethe. In the same manner, his imagination
      appears to have been much struck by the notion of his lecturer,
      that the circumstance mentioned in Job of the Almighty summoning
      Satan into his presence was to be interpreted, not, as he
      thought, allegorically and poetically, but literally. More than
      once we find him expressing to Dr. Kennedy "how much this
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg089" id="pg089">089</a></span>
      belief of the real appearance of Satan to hear and obey the
      commands of God added to his views of the grandeur and majesty of
      the Creator."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, the interest of these Conversations, as far as
      regards Lord Byron, arises not so much from any new or certain
      lights they supply us with on the subject of his religious
      opinions, as from the evidence they afford of his amiable
      facility of intercourse, the total absence of bigotry or
      prejudice from even his most favourite notions, and&mdash;what
      may be accounted, perhaps, the next step in conversion to belief
      itself&mdash;his disposition to believe. As far, indeed, as a
      frank submission to the charge of being wrong may be supposed to
      imply an advance on the road to being right, few persons, it must
      be acknowledged, under a process of proselytism, ever showed more
      of this desired symptom of change than Lord Byron. "I own," says
      a witness to one of these conversations<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, "I felt astonished to hear Lord Byron submit
      to lectures on his life, his vanity, and the uselessness of his
      talents, which made me stare."

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      As most persons will be tempted to refer to the work itself,
      there are but one or two other opinions of his Lordship recorded
      in it which I shall think necessary to notice here. A frequent
      question of his to Dr. Kennedy was,&mdash;"What, then, you think
      me in a very bad way?"&mdash;the usual answer to which being in
      the affirmative, he, on one occasion, replied,&mdash;"I am now,
      however, in a fairer way. I <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg090"
      id="pg090">090</a></span> already believe in predestination,
      which I know you believe, and in the depravity of the human heart
      in general, and of my own in particular:&mdash;thus you see there
      are two points in which we agree. I shall get at the others by
      and by; but you cannot expect me to become a perfect Christian at
      once." On the subject of Dr. Southwood's amiable and, it is to be
      hoped for the sake of Christianity and the human race,
      <i>orthodox</i> work on "The Divine Government," he thus
      spoke:&mdash;"I cannot decide the point; but to my present
      apprehension it would be a most desirable thing could it be
      proved, that ultimately all created beings were to be happy. This
      would appear to be most consistent with God, whose power is
      omnipotent, and whose chief attribute is Love. I cannot yield to
      your doctrine of the eternal duration of punishment. This
      author's opinion is more humane, and I think he supports it very
      strongly from Scripture."

    <p>
      I shall now insert, with such explanatory remarks as they may
      seem to require, some of the letters, official as well as
      private, which his Lordship wrote while at Cephalonia; and from
      which the reader may collect, in a manner far more interesting
      than through the medium of any narrative, a knowledge both of the
      events now passing in Greece, and of the views and feelings with
      which they were regarded by Lord Byron.

      To Madame Guiccioli he wrote frequently, but briefly, and, for

      mart; but the miserable Ionian merchants have little money, and
      no great credit, and are besides <i>politically shy</i> on this
      occasion; for although I had letters of Messrs. Webb (one of the
      strongest houses of the Mediterranean), and also of Messrs.
      Ransom, there is no business to be done on <i>fair</i> terms

      shall have my co-operation in all his endeavours: but, from every
      thing that I can learn, the formation of a brigade at present
      will be extremely difficult, to say the least of it. With regard
      to the reception of foreigners,&mdash;at least of foreign
      officers,&mdash;I refer you to a passage in Prince Mavrocordato's
      recent letter, a copy of which is enclosed in my packet sent to
      the Deputies. It is my intention to proceed by sea to Napoli di
      Romania as soon as I have arranged this business for the Greeks

      perceive by some former documents that any advantage from my
      <i>then</i> proceeding to the Morea was doubtful. We have at last
      moved the Deputies, and I have made a strong remonstrance on
      their divisions to Mavrocordato, which, I understand, was
      forwarded by the Legislative to the Prince. With a loan they
      <i>may</i> do much, which is all that <i>I</i>, for particular
      reasons, can say on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I regret to hear from Colonel Stanhope that the Committee have
      exhausted their funds. Is it supposed that a brigade can be
      formed without them? or that three thousand pounds would be
      sufficient? It is true that money will go farther in Greece than
      in most countries; but the regular force must be rendered a
      <i>national concern</i>, and paid from a national fund; and
      neither individuals nor committees, at least with the usual means
      of such as now exist, will find the experiment practicable.

    </p>
    <p>
      "The affair of the Loan, the expectations so long and vainly
      indulged of the arrival of the Greek fleet, and the danger to
      which Missolonghi is still exposed, have detained me here, and
      will still detain me till some of them are removed. But when the
      money shall be advanced for the fleet, I will start for the
      Morea; not knowing, however, of what use my presence can be in
      the present state of things. We have heard some rumours of new
      dissensions, nay, of the existence of a civil war. With all my
      heart I pray that these reports may be false or exaggerated, for
      I can imagine no calamity more serious than this; and I must
      frankly confess, that unless union and order are established, all
      hopes of a Loan will be vain; and all the assistance which the
      Greeks could expect from abroad&mdash;an assistance neither
      trifling nor worthless&mdash;will be suspended or destroyed; and,
      what is worse, the great powers of Europe, of whom no one was an
      enemy to Greece, but seemed to favour her establishment of an
      independent power, will be persuaded that the Greeks are unable
      to govern themselves, and will, perhaps, themselves undertake to
      settle your disorders in such a way as to blast the brightest
      hopes of yourselves and of your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to add, once for all,&mdash;I desire the well-being of
      Greece, and nothing else; I will do all I can to secure it; but I
      cannot consent, I never will <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg096" id="pg096">096</a></span> consent, that the English
      public, or English individuals, should be deceived as to the real
      state of Greek affairs. The rest, Gentlemen, depends on you. You
      have fought gloriously;&mdash;act honourably towards your
      fellow-citizens and the world, and it will then no more be said,
      as has been repeated for two thousand years with the Roman
      historians, that Philopoemen was the last of the Grecians. Let
      not calumny itself (and it is difficult, I own, to guard against
      it in so arduous a struggle,) compare the patriot Greek, when
      resting from his labours, to the Turkish pacha, whom his
      victories have exterminated.

      of Major-General the Earl of Harrington, &amp;c. &amp;c. He has
      arrived from London in fifty days, after having visited all the
      Committees of Germany. He is charged by our Committee to act in
      concert with me for the liberation of Greece. I conceive that his
      name and his mission will be a sufficient recommendation, without
      the necessity of any other from a foreigner, although one who, in
      common with all Europe, respects and admires the <span class=

      talents, and, above all, the probity of Prince Mavrocordato.

    <p>
      "I am very uneasy at hearing that the dissensions of Greece still
      continue, and at a moment when she might triumph over every thing
      in general, as she has already triumphed in part. Greece is, at
      present, placed between three measures: either to reconquer her
      liberty, to become a dependence of the sovereigns of Europe, or
      to return to a Turkish province. She has the choice only of these
      three alternatives. Civil war is but a road which leads to the
      two latter. If she is desirous of the fate of Walachia and the
      Crimea, she may obtain it to-morrow; if of that of Italy, the day
      after; but if she wishes to become truly Greece, free and
      independent, she must resolve to-day, or she will never again
      have the opportunity.

      "I confirm the above<span class="fnref">[1]</span>: it is
      certainly my opinion that Mr. Millingen is entitled to the same
      salary with Mr. Tindall, and his service is likely to be harder.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: He here alludes to a letter, forwarded with his
        own, from Mr. Millingen, who was about to join, in his medical
        capacity, the Suliotes, near Fatras, and requested of the
        Committee an increase of pay. This gentleman, having mentioned
        in his letter "that the retreat of the Turks from before
        Missolonghi had rendered unnecessary the appearance of the
        Greek fleet," Lord Byron, in a note on this passage, says, "By
        the special providence of the Deity, the Mussulmans were seized
        with a panic, and fled; but no thanks to the fleet, which ought
        to have been here months ago, and has no excuse to the
        contrary, lately&mdash;at least since I had the money ready to
        pay."

        On another passage, in which Mr. Millingen complains that his
        hope of any remuneration from the Greeks has "turned out
        perfectly chimerical," Lord Byron remarks, in a note, "and
        <i>will</i> do so, till they obtain a loan. They have not a
        rap, nor credit (in the islands) to raise one. A medical man
        may succeed better than others; but all these penniless
        officers had better have stayed at home. Much money may not be
        required, but some must."]

      two hundred thousand piastres (deducting the commission and

      Suliotes (now in Acarnania) are very anxious that I should take
      them under my directions, and go over and put things to rights in
      the Morea, which, without a force, seems impracticable; and,
      really, though very reluctant (as my letters will have shown you)
      to take such a measure, there seems hardly any milder remedy.
      However, I will not do any thing rashly, and have only continued
      here so long in the hope of seeing things reconciled, and have

      personal, I can say, from my own knowledge, as well as from all

      military: in short, a better or a braver man is not easily to be
      found. <i>He</i> is our man to lead a regular force, or to
      organise a national one for the Greeks. Ask the army&mdash;ask
      any one. He is besides a personal friend of both Prince
      Mavrocordato, Colonel Stanhope, and myself, and in such concord

      indispensable, as well as a rare point, especially in Greece at

      the offensive, instead of being reduced to the <i>petite

      taking a few ships, and starving out a castle, and making more

    <p>
      "Colonel Stanhope is at Missolonghi. Probably we shall attempt
      Patras next. The Suliotes, who are friends of mine, seem anxious
      to have me with them, and so is Mavrocordato. If I can but
      succeed in reconciling the two parties (and I have left no stone
      unturned), it will be something; and if not, we roust go over to
      the Morea with the Western Greeks&mdash;who <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg105" id="pg105">105</a></span> are the
      bravest, and at present the strongest, having beaten back the
      Turks&mdash;and try the effect of a little <i>physical</i>
      advice, should they persist in rejecting <i>moral</i> persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more recommending to you the reinforcement of my strong box
      and credit from all lawful sources and resources of mine to their
      practicable extent&mdash;for, after all, it is better playing at
      nations than gaming at Almack's or Newmarket&mdash;and requesting
      you to write to me as often as you can,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remain ever," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squadron, so long looked for, having made its appearance at
      last in the waters of Missolonghi, and Mavrocordato, the only
      leader of the cause worthy the name of statesman, having been
      appointed, with full powers, to organise Western Greece, the fit
      moment for Lord Byron's presence on the scene of action seemed to
      have arrived. The anxiety, indeed, with which he was expected at
      Missolonghi was intense, and can be best judged from the
      impatient language of the letters written to hasten him. "I need
      not tell you, my Lord," says Mavrocordato, "how much I long for
      your arrival, to what a pitch your presence is desired by every
      body, or what a prosperous direction it will give to all our
      affairs. Your counsels will be listened to like oracles." Colonel
      Stanhope, with the same urgency, writes from
      Missolonghi,&mdash;"The Greek ship sent for your Lordship has
      returned; your arrival was anticipated, and the disappointment
      has been great indeed. The Prince is in a state of anxiety, the
      Admiral <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg106" id=
      "pg106">106</a></span> looks gloomy, and the sailors grumble
      aloud." He adds at the end, "I walked along the streets this
      evening, and the people asked me after Lord Byron !!!" In a
      Letter to the London Committee of the same date, Colonel Stanhope
      says, "All are looking forward to Lord Byron's arrival, as they
      would to the coming of the Messiah."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this anxiety, no inconsiderable part is doubtless to be
      attributed to their great impatience for the possession of the
      loan which he had promised them, and on which they wholly
      depended for the payment of the fleet&mdash;"Prince Mavrocordato
      and the Admiral (says the same gentleman) are in a state of
      extreme perplexity: they, it seems, relied on your loan for the
      payment of the fleet; that loan not having been received, the
      sailors will depart immediately. This will be a fatal event
      indeed, as it will place Missolonghi in a state of blockade; and
      will prevent the Greek troops from acting against the fortresses
      of Nepacto and Patras."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time Lord Byron was preparing busily for his
      departure, the postponement of which latterly had been, in a
      great measure, owing to that repugnance to any new change of
      place which had lately so much grown upon him, and which neither
      love, as we have seen, nor ambition, could entirely conquer.
      There had been also considerable pains taken by some of his
      friends at Argostoli to prevent his fixing upon a place of
      residence so unhealthy as Missolonghi; and Mr. Muir, a very able
      medical officer, on whose talents he had much dependence,
      endeavoured most earnestly to dissuade him from such an imprudent
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg107" id="pg107">107</a></span>
      step. His mind, however, was made up,&mdash;the proximity of that
      port, in some degree, tempting him,&mdash;and having hired, for
      himself and suite, a light, fast-sailing vessel, called the
      Mistico, with a boat for part of his baggage, and a larger vessel
      for the remainder, the horses, &amp;c. he was, on the 26th of
      December, ready to sail. The wind, however, being contrary, he
      was detained two days longer, and in this interval the following
      letters were written.

      in hand, but I shall require all that can be got
      together;&mdash;and (if Douglas has completed the sale of
      Rochdale, <i>that</i> and my year's income for next year ought to
      form a good round sum,)&mdash;as you may perceive that there will

      mathematical instruments are thrown away&mdash;none of the Greeks
      know a problem from a poker&mdash;we must conquer first, and plan
      afterwards. The use of the trumpets, too, may be doubted, unless

      will stick by the cause while a plank remains which can be
      <i>honourably</i> clung to. If I quit it, it will be by the

      It is hardly necessary to direct the attention of the reader to
      the sad, and but too true anticipation expressed in this
      letter&mdash;the last but one I was ever to receive from my
      friend. Before we accompany him to the closing scene of all his
      toils, I shall here, as briefly as possible, give a selection
      from the many characteristic anecdotes told of him, while at
      Cephalonia, where (to use the words of Colonel Stanhope, in a
      letter from thence to the Greek committee,) he was "beloved by
      Cephalonians, by English, and by Greeks;" and where, approached
      as he was familiarly by persons of all classes and countries, not
      an action, not a word is recorded of him that does not bear
      honourable testimony to the benevolence and soundness
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg111" id="pg111">111</a></span>
      of his views, his ever ready but discriminating generosity, and
      the clear insight, at once minute and comprehensive, which he had
      acquired into the character and wants of the people and the cause
      he came to serve. "Of all those who came to help the Greeks,"
      says Colonel Napier, (a person himself the most qualified to
      judge, as well from long local knowledge, as from the acute,
      straightforward cast of his own mind,) "I never knew one, except
      Lord Byron and Mr. Gordon, that seemed to have justly estimated
      their character. All came expecting to find the Peloponnesus
      filled with Plutarch's men, and all returned thinking the
      inhabitants of Newgate more moral. Lord Byron judged them fairly:
      he knew that half-civilised men are full of vices, and that great
      allowance must be made for emancipated slaves. He, therefore,
      proceeded, bridle in hand, not thinking them good, but hoping to
      make them better."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: A similar tribute was paid to him by Count
        Delladecima, a gentleman of some literary acquirements, of whom
        he saw a good deal at Cephalonia, and to whom he was attracted
        by that sympathy which never failed to incline him towards
        those who laboured, like himself, under any personal defects.
        "Of all the men," said this gentleman, "whom I have had an
        opportunity of conversing with, on the means of establishing
        the independence of Greece, and regenerating the character of
        the natives, Lord Byron appears to entertain the most
        enlightened and correct views."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In speaking of the foolish charge of avarice brought against Lord
      Byron by some who resented thus his not suffering them to impose
      on his generosity, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg112" id=
      "pg112">112</a></span> Colonel Napier says, "I never knew a
      single instance of it while he was here. I saw only a judicious
      generosity in all that he did. He would not allow himself to be
      <i>robbed</i>, but he gave profusely where he thought he was
      doing good. It was, indeed, because he would not allow himself to
      be <i>fleeced</i>, that he was called stingy by those who are
      always bent upon giving money from any purses but their own. Lord
      Byron had no idea of this; and would turn sharply and
      unexpectedly on those who thought their game sure. He gave a vast
      deal of money to the Greeks in various ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the objects of his bounty in this way were many poor
      refugee Greeks from the Continent and the Isles. He not only
      relieved their present distresses, but allotted a certain sum
      monthly to the most destitute. "A list of these poor pensioners,"
      says Dr. Kennedy, "was given me by the nephew of Professor
      Bambas."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the instances mentioned of his humanity while at
      Cephalonia will show how prompt he was at the call of that
      feeling, and how unworthy, sometimes, were the objects of it. A
      party of workmen employed upon one of those fine roads projected
      by Colonel Napier having imprudently excavated a high bank, the
      earth fell in, and overwhelmed nearly a dozen persons; the news
      of which accident instantly reaching Metaxata, Lord Byron
      despatched his physician Bruno to the spot, and followed with
      Count Gamba, as soon as their horses could be saddled. They found
      a crowd of women and children wailing round the ruins; while the
      workmen, who had just dug out <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg113" id="pg113">113</a></span> three or four of their maimed
      companions, stood resting themselves unconcernedly, as if nothing
      more was required of them; and to Lord Byron's enquiry whether
      there were not still some other persons below the earth, answered
      coolly that "they did not know, but believed that there were."
      Enraged at this brutal indifference, he sprang from his horse,
      and seizing a spade himself, began to dig with all his strength;
      but it was not till after being threatened with the horsewhip
      that any of the peasants could be brought to follow his example.
      "I was not present at this scene myself," says Colonel Napier, in
      the Notices with which he has favoured me, "but was told that
      Lord Byron's attention seemed quite absorbed in the study of the
      faces and gesticulations of those whose friends were missing. The
      sorrow of the Greeks is, in appearance, very frantic, and they
      shriek and howl, as in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in alluding to the above incident that the noble poet is
      stated to have said that he had come out to the Islands
      prejudiced against Sir T. Maitland's government of the Greeks:
      "but," he added, "I have now changed my opinion. They are such
      barbarians, that if I had the government of them, I would pave
      these very roads with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      While residing at Metaxata, he received an account of the illness
      of his daughter Ada, which "made him anxious and melancholy (says
      Count Gamba) for several days." Her indisposition he understood
      to have been caused by a determination of blood to the head; and
      on his remarking to Dr. Kennedy, as curious, that it was a
      complaint to which <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg114" id=
      "pg114">114</a></span> he himself was subject, the physician
      replied, that he should have been inclined to infer so, not only
      from his habits of intense and irregular study, but from the
      present state of his eyes,&mdash;the right eye appearing to be
      inflamed. I have mentioned this latter circumstance as perhaps
      justifying the inference that there was in Lord Byron's state of
      health at this moment a predisposition to the complaint of which
      he afterwards died. To Dr. Kennedy he spoke frequently of his
      wife and daughter, expressing the Strongest affection for the
      latter, and respect towards the former, and while declaring as
      usual his perfect ignorance of the causes of the separation,
      professing himself fully disposed to welcome any prospect of
      reconcilement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anxiety with which, at all periods of his life, but
      particularly at the present, he sought to repel the notion that,
      except when under the actual inspiration of writing, he was at
      all influenced by poetical associations, very frequently
      displayed itself. "You must have been highly gratified (said a
      gentleman to him) by the classical remains and recollections
      which you met with in your visit to Ithaca."&mdash;"You quite
      mistake me," answered Lord Byron&mdash;"I have no poetical humbug
      about me; I am too old for that. Ideas of that sort are confined
      to rhyme."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the two days during which he was delayed by contrary winds,
      he took up his abode at the house of Mr. Hancock, his banker, and
      passed the greater part of the time in company with the English
      authorities of the Island. At length the wind becoming fair, he
      prepared to embark. "I called upon him to take <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg115" id="pg115">115</a></span> leave," says
      Dr. Kennedy, "and found him alone, reading Quentin Durward. He
      was, as usual, in good spirits." In a few hours after the party
      set sail,&mdash;Lord Byron himself on board the Mistico, and
      Count Gamba, with the horses and heavy baggage, in the larger
      vessel, or Bombarda. After touching at Zante, for the purpose of
      some pecuniary arrangements with Mr. Barff, and taking on board a
      considerable sum of money in specie, they, on the evening of the
      29th, proceeded towards Missolonghi. Their last accounts from
      that place having represented the Turkish fleet as still in the
      Gulf of Lepanto, there appeared not the slightest grounds for
      apprehending any interruption in their passage. Besides, knowing
      that the Greek squadron was now at anchorage near the entrance of
      the Gulf, they had little doubt of soon falling in with some
      friendly vessel, either in search, or waiting for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We sailed together," says Count Gamba, in a highly picturesque
      and affecting passage, "till after ten at night; the wind
      favourable&mdash;a clear sky, the air fresh but not sharp. Our
      sailors sang alternately patriotic songs, monotonous indeed, but
      to persons in our situation extremely touching, and we took part
      in them. We were all, but Lord Byron particularly, in excellent
      spirits. The Mistico sailed the fastest. When the waves divided
      us, and our voices could no longer reach each other, we made
      signals by firing pistols and carabines&mdash;'To-morrow we meet
      at Missolonghi&mdash;to-morrow.' Thus, full of confidence and
      spirits, we sailed along. At twelve we were out of sight of each
      other." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg116" id=
      "pg116">116</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In waiting for the other vessel, having more than once shortened
      sail for that purpose, the party on board the Mistico were upon
      the point of being surprised into an encounter which might, in a
      moment, have changed the future fortunes of Lord Byron. Two or
      three hours before daybreak, while steering towards Missolonghi,
      they found themselves close under the stern of a large vessel,
      which they at first took to be Greek, but which, when within
      pistol shot, they discovered to be a Turkish frigate. By good
      fortune, they were themselves, as it appears, mistaken for a
      Greek brulot by the Turks, who therefore feared to fire, but with
      loud shouts frequently hailed them, while those on board Lord
      Byron's vessel maintained the most profound silence; and even the
      dogs (as I have heard his Lordship's valet mention), though they
      had never ceased to bark during the whole of the night, did not
      utter, while within reach of the Turkish frigate, a
      sound;&mdash;a no less lucky than a curious accident, as, from
      the information the Turks had received of all the particulars of
      his Lordship's departure from Zante, the harking of the dogs, at
      that moment, would have been almost certain to betray him. Under
      the favour of these circumstances, and the darkness, they were
      enabled to bear away without further molestation, and took
      shelter among the Scrofes, a cluster of rocks but a few hours'
      sail from Missolonghi. From this place the following letter,
      remarkable, considering his situation at the moment, for the
      light, careless tone that pervades it, was despatched to Colonel
      Stanhope. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg117" id=

      "My dear Stanhope,
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are just arrived here, that is, part of my people and I, with
      some things, &amp;c., and which it may be as well not to specify
      in a letter (which has a risk of being intercepted,
      perhaps);&mdash;but Gamba, and my horses, negro, steward, and the
      press, and all the Committee things, also some eight thousand
      dollars of mine, (but never mind, we have more left, do you
      understand?) are taken by the Turkish frigates, and my party and
      myself, in another boat, have had a narrow escape last night,
      (being close under their stern and hailed, but we would not
      answer, and bore away,) as well as this morning. Here we are,
      with the sun and clearing weather, within a pretty little port
      enough; but whether our Turkish friends may not send in their
      boats and take us out (for we have no arms except two carbines
      and some pistols, and, I suspect, not more than four fighting
      people on board,) is another question, especially if we remain
      long here, since we are blocked out of Missolonghi by the direct
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better send my friend George Drake (Draco), and a body
      of Suliotes, to escort us by land or by the canals, with all
      convenient speed. Gamba and our Bombard are taken into Patras, I
      suppose; and we must take a turn at the Turks to get them out:
      but where the devil is the fleet gone?&mdash;the Greek, I mean;
      leaving us to get in without the least <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg118" id="pg118">118</a></span> intimation to
      take heed that the Moslems were out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make my respects to Mavrocordato, and say that I am here at his
      disposal. I am uneasy at being here: not so much on my own
      account as on that of a Greek boy with me, for you know what his
      fate would be; and I would sooner cut him in pieces, and myself
      too, than have him taken out by those barbarians. We are all very
      well. N. B.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Bombard was twelve miles out when taken; at least, so it
      appeared to us (if taken she actually be, for it is not certain);
      and we had to escape from another vessel that stood right between
      us and the port."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that his position among the rocks of the Scrofes would be
      untenable in the event of an attack by armed boats, he thought it
      right to venture out again, and making all sail, got safe to
      Dragomestri, a small sea-port town on the coast of Acarnania;
      from whence the annexed letters to two of the most valued of his
      Cephalonian friends were written.

      "Dragomestri, January 2. 1824.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Muir,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you many returns of the season, and happiness
      therewithal. Gamba and the Bombard (there is a strong reason to
      believe) are carried into Patras by a Turkish frigate, which we
      saw chase them at dawn on the 31st: we had been close under the
      stern in the night, believing her a Greek till <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg119" id="pg119">119</a></span> within pistol
      shot, and only escaped by a miracle of all the Saints (our
      captain says), and truly I am of his opinion, for we should never
      have got away of ourselves. They were signalising their consort
      with lights, and had illuminated the ship between decks, and were
      shouting like a mob;&mdash;but then why did they not fire?
      Perhaps they took us for a Greek brulot, and were afraid of
      kindling us&mdash;they had no colours flying even at dawn nor
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At daybreak my boat was on the coast, but the wind unfavourable
      for <i>the port</i>;&mdash;a large vessel with the wind in her
      favour standing between us and the Gulf, and another in chase of
      the Bombard about twelve miles off, or so. Soon after they stood
      (<i>i.e.</i> the Bombard and frigate) apparently towards Patras,
      and a Zantiote boat making signals to us from the shore to get
      away. Away we went before the wind, and ran into a creek called
      Scrofes, I believe, where I landed Luke<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> and another (as Luke's life was in most
      danger), with some money for themselves, and a letter for
      Stanhope, and sent them up the country to Missolonghi, where they
      would be in safety, as the place where we were could be assailed
      by armed boats in a moment, and Gamba had all our arms except two
      carbines, a fowling-piece, and some pistols.

      "In less than an hour the vessel in chase neared us, and we
      dashed out again, and showing our stern (our boat sails very
      well), got in before night to Dragomestri, where we now are. But
      where is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg120" id=
      "pg120">120</a></span> Greek fleet? I don't know&mdash;do you? I
      told our master of the boat that I was inclined to think the two
      large vessels (there were none else in sight) Greeks. But he
      answered, 'They are too large&mdash;why don't they show their
      colours?' and his account was confirmed, be it true or false, by
      several boats which we met or passed, as we could not at any rate
      have got in with that wind without beating about for a long time;
      and as there was much property, and some lives to risk (the boy's
      especially) without any means of defence, it was necessary to let
      our boatmen have their own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I despatched yesterday another messenger to Missolonghi for an
      escort, but we have yet no answer. We are here (those of my boat)
      for the fifth day without taking our clothes off, and sleeping on
      deck in all weathers, but are all very well, and in good spirits.
      It is to be supposed that the Government will send, for their own
      sakes, an escort, as I have 16,000 dollars on board, the greater
      part for their service. I had (besides personal property to the
      amount of about 5000 more) 8000 dollars in specie of my own,
      without reckoning the Committee's stores, so that the Turks will
      have a good thing of it, if the prize be good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I regret the detention of Gamba, &amp;c., but the rest we can
      make up again; so tell Hancock to set my bills into cash as soon
      as possible, and Corgialegno to prepare the remainder of my
      credit with Messrs. Webb to be turned into monies. I shall remain
      here, unless something extraordinary occurs, till Mavrocordato
      sends, and then go on, and act <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg121" id="pg121">121</a></span> according to circumstances. My
      respects to the two colonels, and remembrances to all friends.
      Tell '<i>Ultima Anahse</i>'<span class="fnref">[1]</span> that
      his friend Raidi did not make his appearance with the brig,
      though I think that he might as well have spoken with us

      will be lawful prize or no, is for the decision of the Governor
      of the Seven Islands. I have written to Dr. Muir, by way of
      Kalamo, with all particulars. We are in good condition; and what
      with wind and weather, and being hunted or so, little sleeping on
      deck, &amp;c. are in tolerable seasoning for the country and
      circumstances. But I foresee that we shall have occasion for all
      the cash I can muster at Zante and elsewhere. Mr. Barff gave us
      8000 and odd dollars; so there is still a balance in my favour.
      We are not quite certain that the vessels were Turkish which
      chased; but there is strong presumption that they were, and no
      news to the contrary. At Zante, every body, from the Resident

    <p>
      During these adventures of Lord Byron, Count Gamba, having been
      brought to by the Turkish frigate, had been carried, with his
      valuable charge, into Patras, where the Commander of the Turkish
      fleet was stationed. Here, after an interview with the Pacha, by
      whom he was treated, during his detention, most courteously, he
      had the good fortune to procure the release of his vessel and
      freight; and, on the 4th of January, reached Missolonghi. To his
      surprise, however, he found that Lord Byron had not yet arrived;
      for,&mdash;as if everything connected with this short voyage were
      doomed to deepen whatever ill bodings there were already in his
      mind,&mdash;on his Lordship's departure from Dragomestri, a
      violent gale of wind had come on; his vessel was twice driven on
      the rocks in the passage of the Scrofes, and, from the force of
      the wind, and the captain's ignorance of those shoals, the danger
      was by all on board considered to be most serious. "On the second
      time of striking," says Count Gamba, "the sailors, losing all
      hope of saving the vessel, began to think of their own safety.
      But Lord Byron persuaded them to remain; and by his firmness, and
      no small share of nautical skill, got them out of danger, and
      thus saved the vessel and several lives, with 25,000 dollars, the
      greater part in specie."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind still blowing right against their course <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg124" id="pg124">124</a></span> to
      Missolonghi, they again anchored between two of the numerous
      islets by which this part of the coast is lined; and here Lord
      Byron, as well for refreshment as ablution, found himself tempted
      into an indulgence which, it is not improbable, may have had some
      share in producing the fatal illness that followed. Having put
      off in a boat to a small rock at some distance, he sent back a
      messenger for the nankeen trowsers which he usually wore in
      bathing; and, though the sea was rough and the night cold, it
      being then the 3d of January, swam back to the vessel. "I am
      fully persuaded," says his valet, in relating this imprudent
      freak, "that it injured my Lord's health. He certainly was not
      taken ill at the time, but in the course of two or three days his
      Lordship complained of a pain in all his bones, which continued,
      more or less, to the time of his death."
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting sail again next morning with the hope of reaching
      Missolonghi before sunset, they were still baffled by adverse
      winds, and, arriving late at night in the port, did not land till
      the morning of the 5th.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solicitude, in the mean time, of all at Missolonghi, knowing
      that the Turkish fleet was out, and Lord Byron on his way, may
      without difficulty be conceived, and is most livelily depicted in
      a letter written during the suspense of that moment, by an
      eye-witness. "The Turkish fleet," says Colonel Stanhope, "has
      ventured out, and is, at this moment, blockading the port. Beyond
      these again are seen the Greek ships, and among the rest the one
      that was sent for Lord Byron. Whether he is on board or not is a
      question. You will allow that this is an <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg125" id="pg125">125</a></span> eventful
      day." Towards the end of the letter, he adds, "Lord Byron's
      servants have just arrived; he himself will be here to-morrow. If
      he had not come, we had need have prayed for fair weather; for
      both fleet and army are hungry and inactive. Parry has not
      appeared. Should he also arrive to-morrow, all Missolonghi will
      go mad with pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reception their noble visiter experienced on his arrival was
      such as, from the ardent eagerness with which he had been looked
      for, might be expected. The whole population of the place crowded
      to the shore to welcome him: the ships anchored off the fortress
      fired a salute as he passed; and all the troops and dignitaries
      of the place, civil and military, with the Prince Mavrocordato at
      their head, met him on his landing, and accompanied him, amidst
      the mingled din of shouts, wild music, and discharges of
      artillery, to the house that had been prepared for him. "I cannot
      easily describe," says Count Gamba, "the emotions which such a
      scene excited. I could scarcely refrain from tears."
    </p>
    <p>
      After eight days of fatigue such as Lord Byron had endured, some
      short interval of rest might fairly have been desired by him. But
      the scene on which he had now entered was one that precluded all
      thoughts of repose. He on whom the eyes and hopes of all others
      were centred, could but little dream of indulging any care for
      himself. There were, at this particular moment, too, collected
      within the precincts of that town as great an abundance of the
      materials of unquiet and misrule as had been ever brought
      together in so small a space. In every <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg126" id="pg126">126</a></span> quarter; both
      public and private, disorganisation and dissatisfaction presented
      themselves. Of the fourteen brigs of war which had come to the
      succour of Missolonghi, and which had for some time actually
      protected it against a Turkish fleet double its number, nine had
      already, hopeless of pay, returned to Hydra, while the sailors of
      the remaining five, from the same cause of complaint, had just
      quitted their ships, and were murmuring idly on shore. The
      inhabitants, seeing themselves thus deserted or preyed upon by
      their defenders, with a scarcity of provisions threatening them,
      and the Turkish fleet before their eyes, were no less ready to
      break forth into riot and revolt; while, at the same moment, to
      complete the confusion, a General Assembly was on the point of
      being held in the town, for the purpose of organising the forces
      of Western Greece, and to this meeting all the wild mountain
      chiefs of the province, ripe, of course, for dissension, were now
      flocking with their followers. Mavrocordato himself, the
      President of the intended Congress, had brought in his train no
      less than 5000 armed men, who were at this moment in the town.
      Ill provided, too, with either pay or food by the Government,
      this large military mob were but little less discontented and
      destitute than the sailors; and in short, in every direction, the
      entire population seems to have presented such a fermenting mass
      of insubordination and discord as was far more likely to produce
      warfare among themselves than with the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of affairs when Lord Byron arrived at
      Missolonghi;&mdash;such the evils he had now <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg127" id="pg127">127</a></span> to encounter,
      with the formidable consciousness that to him, and him alone, all
      looked for the removal of them.

    <p>
      Of his proceedings during the first weeks after his arrival, the
      following letters to Mr. Hancock (which by the great kindness of
      that gentleman I am enabled to give) will, assisted by a few
      explanatory notes, supply a sufficiently ample account.

      the Turks safe and intact; nobody knows well how or why, for
      there's a mystery in the story somewhat melodramatic. Captain
      Valsamachi has, I take it, spun a long yarn by this time in
      Argostoli. I attribute their release entirely to Saint Dionisio,
      of Zante, and the Madonna of the Rock, near Cephalonia.

      Dragomestri; we were conveyed out by some Greek gun-boats, and
      found the Leonidas brig-of-war at sea to look after us. But
      blowing weather coming on, we were driven on the rocks
      <i>twice</i> in the passage of the Scrofes, and the dollars had
      another narrow escape. Two thirds of the crew got ashore over the
      bowsprit: the rocks were rugged enough, but water very deep close
      in shore, so that she was, after much swearing and some exertion,
      got off again, and away we went with a third <span class=

      leaving the rest on a desolate island, where they might have been

      no condition to take them off again.

      telling him of the fact that there was no danger for the
      passengers, whatever there might be for the vessel, and assuring
      him that I could save both him and myself without
      difficulty<span class="fnref">[1]</span> (though he can't swim),

        described, as might be expected, somewhat
        differently:&mdash;"Ma nel di lui passaggio marittimo una
        fregata Turca insegui la di lui nave, obligandola di
        ricoverarsi dentro le <i>Scrofes</i>, dove per l'impeto dei
        venti fù gettata sopra i scogli: tutti i marinari dell'
        equipaggio saltarono a terra per salvare la loro vita: Milord
        solo col di lui Medico Dottr. Bruno rimasero sulla nave che
        ognuno vedeva colare a fondo: ma dopo qualche tempo non
        essendosi visto che ciò avveniva, le persone fuggite a terra
        respinsero la nave nell' acque: ma il tempestoso mare la
        ribastò una seconda volta contro i scogli, ed allora si aveva
        per certo che la nave coll' illustre personaggio, una grande
        quantità di denari, e molti preziosi effetti per i Greci
        anderebbero a fondo. Tuttavia Lord Byron non si perturbò per
        nulla; anzi disse al di lui medico che voleva gettarsi al nuoto
        onde raggiungere la spiaggia: 'Non abbandonate la nave finchè
        abbiamo forze per direggerla: allorchè saremo coperti dall'
        acque, allora gettatevi pure, che io vi salvo.'"]

      "To be brief, we had bad weather almost always, though not
      contrary; slept on deck in the wet generally for seven or eight
      nights, but never was in better health (I speak
      personally)&mdash;so much so that I actually bathed for a quarter

      accompany them either as a Chief, or whichever is most agreeable
      to the Government,) besides sundries. I do not understand Brown's
      '<i>letters of credit</i>.' I neither gave nor ordered a letter
      of credit that I know of; and though of course, if you have done
      it, I will be responsible, I was not aware of any thing, except
      that I would have backed his bills, which you said was
      unnecessary. As to <i>orders</i>&mdash;I ordered nothing but some
      <i>red cloth</i> and <i>oil cloths</i>, both of which I am ready
      to receive; but if Gamba has exceeded my commission, <i>the other

      for, though <i>that</i> is exorbitant. As for Brown's letter, I
      do not know any thing more than I have said, and I really cannot
      defray the charges of half Greece and the Frank adventurers

      "I have answered, at some length, your obliging letter, and trust
      that you have received my reply by means of Mr. Tindal. I will
      also thank you to remind Mr. Tindal that I would thank him to
      furnish you, on my account, with <i>an order of the Committee</i>
      for one hundred dollars, which I advanced to him on their account
      through Signor Corgialegno's agency at Zante on his arrival in
      October, as it is but fair that the said Committee should pay
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg132" id="pg132">132</a></span>
      their own expenses. An order will be sufficient, as the money
      might be inconvenient for Mr. T. at present to disburse.

    <p>
      "I have also advanced to Mr. Blackett the sum of fifty
      dollars,-which I will thank Mr. Stevens to pay to you, on my
      account, from monies of Mr. Blackett now in his hands. I have Mr.
      B.'s acknowledgment in writing.

    <p>
      "As the wants of the State here are still pressing, and there
      seems very little specie stirring except mine, I will stand
      paymaster; and must again request you and Mr. Barff to forward by
      a <i>safe</i> channel (if possible) all the dollars you can
      collect upon the bills now negotiating. I have also written to
      Corgialegno for two thousand dollars, being about the balance of
      my separate letter from Messrs. Webb and Co., making the bills
      also payable at Ransom's in London.

      "Things are going on better, if not well; there is some order,
      and considerable preparation. I expect to accompany the troops on
      an expedition shortly, which makes me particularly anxious for
      the remaining remittance, as 'money is the sinew of war,' and of
      peace, too, as far as I can see, for I am sure there would be no
      peace here without it. However, a little does go a good way,
      which is a comfort. The Government of the Morea and of Candia
      have written to me for a further advance from my own peculium of
      20 or 30,000 dollars, to which I demur for the present, (having
      undertaken to pay the Suliotes as a free gift and other things

    <p>
      "Since I wrote on the 17th, I have received a letter from Mr.
      Stevens, enclosing an account from Corfu, which is so exaggerated
      in price and quantity, that I am at a loss whether most to admire
      Gamba's folly, or the merchant's knavery. All that <i>I</i>
      requested Gamba to order was red cloth enough to make a
      <i>jacket</i>, and some oil-skin for trowsers, &amp;c.&mdash;the
      latter has not been sent&mdash;the whole could not have amounted
      to fifty dollars. The account is six hundred and forty-five!!! I
      will guarantee Mr. Stevens against any loss, of course, but I am
      not disposed to take the articles (which I never ordered), nor to
      pay the amount. I will take one hundred dollars' worth; the rest
      may be sent back, and I will make the merchant an allowance of so
      much per-cent.; <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg134" id=
      "pg134">134</a></span> or, if that is not to be done, you must
      sell the whole by auction at what price the things may fetch; for
      I would rather incur the dead loss of <i>part</i>, than be
      encumbered with a quantity of things, to me at present
      superfluous or useless. Why, I could have maintained three
      hundred men for a month for the sum in Western Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the dogs, and the dollars, and the negro; and the horses,
      fell into the hands of the Turks, I acquiesced with patience, as
      you may have perceived, because it was the work of the elements
      of war, or of Providence: but this is a piece of mere human
      knavery or folly, or both, and I neither can nor will submit to
      it.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> I have occasion for every

      dollar I can muster to keep the Greeks together, and I do not
      grudge any expense for the cause; but to throw away as much as
      would equip, or at least maintain, a corps of excellent
      ragamuffins with arms in their hands, to furnish Gamba and the
      Doctor with blank bills (see list), broad cloth, Hessian boots,
      and horsewhips (the <i>latter</i> I own that they have richly
      earned), is rather beyond my endurance, though a pacific person,
      as all the world knows, or at least my acquaintances. I pray you
      to try to help me out of this damnable commercial speculation of
      Gamba's, for it is one of those pieces of impudence or folly
      which I don't forgive him in a hurry. I will of course see
      Stevens free of expense out of the transaction;&mdash;by the way,
      the Greek of a Corfiote has thought proper to draw a bill, and
      get it discounted at 24 dollars: if I had been there, it should
      have been <i>protested</i> also.

        [Footnote 1: We have here as striking an instance as could be
        adduced of that peculiar feature of his character which shallow
        or malicious observers have misrepresented as avarice, but
        which in reality was the result of a strong sense of justice
        and fairness, and an indignant impatience of being stultified
        or over-reached. Colonel Stanhope, in referring to the
        circumstance mentioned above, has put Lord Byron's angry
        feeling respecting it in the true light.
      </p>
      <p>
        "He was constantly attacking Count Gamba, sometimes, indeed,
        playfully, but more often with the bitterest satire, for having
        purchased for the use of his family, while in Greece,
        <i>500</i> dollars' worth of cloth. This he used to mention as
        an instance of the Count's imprudence and extravagance. Lord
        Byron told me one day, with a tone of great gravity, that this
        500 dollars would have been most serviceable in promoting the
        siege of Lepanto; and that he never would, to the last moment
        of his existence, forgive Gamba, for having squandered away his
        money in the purchase of cloth. No one will suppose that Lord
        Byron could be serious in such a denunciation: he entertained,
        in reality, the highest opinion of Conant Gamba, who, both on
        account of his talents and devotedness to his friend, merited
        his Lordship's esteem. As to Lord Byron's generosity, it is
        before the world; he promised to devote his large income to the
        cause of Greece, and he honestly acted up to his pledge."]

      under several months; but he is no better, and, what is odd, no
      worse; and as the doctors have had no better success with him
      than I, he goes to Argostoli, sick of the Greeks and of a
      constipation.

      bedroom into the apartment where Colonel Stanhope and some others
      were assembled, and said with a smile, "You were complaining the
      other day that I never write any poetry now. This is my birthday,
      and I have just finished something which, I think, is better than
      what I usually write." He then produced to them those beautiful
      stanzas, which, though already known to most readers, are far too
      affectingly associated with this closing scene of his life to be
      omitted among its details. Taking into consideration, indeed,
      every thing connected with these verses,&mdash;the last tender
      aspirations of a loving spirit which they breathe, the
      self-devotion to a noble cause which they so nobly express, and

      "We perceived," says Count Gamba, "from these lines, as well as
      from his daily conversations, that his ambition and his hope were
      irrevocably fixed upon the glorious objects of his expedition to
      Greece, and that he had made up his mind to 'return victorious,
      or return no more.' Indeed, he often said <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg139" id="pg139">139</a></span> to me,
      'Others may do as they please&mdash;they may go&mdash;but I stay
      here, <i>that is certain</i>.' The same determination was
      expressed in his letters to his friends; and this resolution was
      not unaccompanied with the very natural presentiment&mdash;that
      he should never leave Greece alive. He one day asked his faithful
      servant, Tita, whether he thought of returning to Italy? 'Yes,'
      said Tita: 'if your Lordship goes, I go.' Lord Byron smiled, and
      said, 'No, Tita, I shall never go back from Greece&mdash;either
      the Turks, or the Greeks, or the climate, will prevent that.'"

      LETTER 540. TO MR. CHARLES HANCOCK.

      "Missolonghi, February 5. 1824.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Muir's letter and yours of the 23d reached me some days ago.
      Tell Muir that I am glad of his promotion for his sake, and of
      his remaining near us for all our sakes; though I cannot but
      regret Dr. Kennedy's departure, which accounts for the previous
      earthquakes and the present English weather in this climate. With
      all respect to my medical pastor, I have to announce to him, that
      amongst other fire-brands, our firemaster Parry (just landed) has
      disembarked an elect blacksmith, intrusted with three hundred and
      twenty-two Greek Testaments. I have given him all facilities in
      my power for his works spiritual and temporal; and if he can
      settle matters as easily with the Greek Archbishop and hierarchy,
      I trust that neither the heretic nor the supposed sceptic will be
      accused of intolerance. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg140" id=
      "pg140">140</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, I met with the said Archbishop at Anatolico (where I
      went by invitation of the Primates a few days ago, and was
      received with a heavier cannonade than the Turks, probably,) for
      the second time (I had known him here before); and he and P.
      Mavrocordato, and the Chiefs and Primates and I, all dined
      together, and I thought the metropolitan the merriest of the
      party, and a very good Christian for all that. But Gamba (we got
      wet through on our way back) has been ill with a fever and
      cholic; and Luke has been out of sorts too, and so have some
      others of the people, and I have been very well,&mdash;except
      that I caught cold yesterday, with swearing too much in the rain
      at the Greeks, who would not bear a hand in landing the Committee
      stores, and nearly spoiled our combustibles; but I turned out in
      person, and made such a row as set them in motion, blaspheming at
      them from the Government downwards, till they actually did
      <i>some</i> part of what they ought to have done several days
      before, and this is esteemed, as it deserves to be, a wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Muir that, notwithstanding his remonstrances, which I
      receive thankfully, it is perhaps best that I should advance with
      the troops; for if we do not do something soon, we shall only
      have a third year of defensive operations and another siege, and
      all that. We hear that the Turks are coming down in force, and
      sooner than usual; and as these fellows do mind me a little, it
      is the opinion that I should go,&mdash;firstly, because they will
      sooner listen to a foreigner than one of their own people, out of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg141" id="pg141">141</a></span>
      native jealousies; secondly, because the Turks will sooner treat
      or capitulate (if such occasion should happen) with a Frank than
      a Greek; and, thirdly, because nobody else seems disposed to take
      the responsibility&mdash;Mavrocordato being very busy here, the
      foreign military men too young or not of authority enough to be
      obeyed by the natives, and the Chiefs (as aforesaid) inclined to
      obey any one except, or rather than, one of their own body. As
      for me, I am willing to do what I am bidden, and to follow my
      instructions. I neither seek nor shun that nor any thing else
      they may wish me to attempt: as for personal safety, besides that
      it ought not to be a consideration, I take it that a man is on
      the whole as safe in one place as another; and, after all, he had
      better end with a bullet than bark in his body. If we are not
      taken off with the sword, we are like to march off with an ague
      in this mud basket; and to conclude with a very bad pun, to the
      ear rather than to the eye, better <i>martially</i> than
      <i>marsh-ally:</i>&mdash;the situation of Missolonghi is not
      unknown to you. The dykes of Holland when broken down are the
      Deserts of Arabia for dryness, in comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for the sinews of war. I thank you and Mr. Barff for
      your ready answers, which, next to ready money, is a pleasant
      thing. Besides the assets and balance, and the relics of the
      Corgialegno correspondence with Leghorn and Genoa, (I sold the
      dog flour, tell him, but not at <i>his</i> price,) I shall
      request and require, from the beginning of March ensuing, about
      five thousand dollars every two months, <i>i.e.</i>, about
      twenty-five thousand within the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg142" id="pg142">142</a></span> current year, at regular
      intervals, independent of the sums now negotiating. I can show
      you documents to prove that these are considerably <i>within</i>
      my supplies for the year in more ways than one; but I do not like
      to tell the Greeks exactly what I <i>could</i> or would advance
      on an emergency, because otherwise, they will double and triple
      their demands, (a disposition that they have already sufficiently
      shown): and though I am willing to do all I can <i>when</i>
      necessary, yet I do not see why they should not help a little;
      for they are not quite so bare as they pretend to be by some
      accounts.

      "I have been interrupted by the arrival of Parry and afterwards
      by the return of Hesketh, who has not brought an answer to my
      epistles, which rather surprises me. You will write soon, I
      suppose. Parry seems a fine rough subject, but will hardly be
      ready for the field these three weeks; he and I will (I think) be
      able to draw together,&mdash;at least, <i>I</i> will not
      interfere with or contradict him in his own department. He
      complains grievously of the mercantile and <i>enthusymusy</i>
      part of the Committee, but greatly praises Gordon and Hume.
      Gordon <i>would</i> have given three or four thousand pounds and
      come out <i>himself</i>, but Kennedy or somebody else disgusted
      him, and thus they have spoiled part of their subscription and
      cramped their operations. Parry says B&mdash;&mdash; is a humbug,
      to which I say nothing. He sorely laments the printing and
      civilising expenses, and wishes that there was not a
      Sunday-school in <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg143" id=
      "pg143">143</a></span> the world, or <i>any</i> school
      <i>here</i> at present, save and except always an academy for
      artilleryship.

    <p>
      "He complained also of the cold, a little to my surprise;
      firstly, because, there being no chimneys, I have used myself to
      do without other warmth than the animal heat and one's cloak, in
      these parts; and, secondly, because I should as soon have
      expected to hear a volcano sneeze, as a firemaster (who is to
      burn a whole fleet) exclaim against the atmosphere. I fully
      expected that his very approach would have scorched up the town
      like the burning-glasses of Archimedes.

    <p>
      "Well, it seems that I am to be Commander-in-Chief, and the post
      is by no means a sinecure, for we are not what Major Sturgeon
      calls 'a set of the most amicable officers.' Whether we shall
      have 'a boxing bout between Captain Sheers and the Colonel,' I
      cannot tell; but, between Suliote chiefs, German barons, English
      volunteers, and adventurers of all nations, we are likely to form
      as goodly an allied army as ever quarrelled beneath the same
      banner.

      "Interrupted again by business yesterday, and it is time to
      conclude my letter. I drew some time since on Mr. Barff for a
      thousand dollars, to complete some money wanted by the
      Government. The said Government got cash on that bill
      <i>here</i>, and at a profit; but the very same fellow who gave
      it to them, after proposing to give me money for other bills on
      Barff to the amount of thirteen hundred dollars, either could
      not, or thought better of it. I had written to <span class=

      advising him, but had afterwards to write to tell him of the
      fellow's having not come up to time. You must really send me the
      balance soon. I have the artillerists and my Suliotes to pay, and
      Heaven knows what besides; and as every thing depends upon
      punctuality, all our operations will be at a standstill unless
      you use despatch. I shall send to Mr. Barff or to you further
      bills on England for three thousand pounds, to be negotiated as
      speedily as you can. I have already stated here and formerly the
      sums I can command at home within the year,&mdash;without
      including my credits, or the bills already negotiated or
      negotiating, as Corgialegno's balance of Mr. Webb's
      letter,&mdash;and my letters from my friends (received by Mr.
      Parry's vessel) confirm what I have already stated. How much I
      may require in the course of the year I can't tell, but I will
      take care that it shall not exceed the means to supply it.

      Demetrius Delladecima (is it our friend in ultima analise?) to
      pay the Committee expenses. I really do not understand what the
      Committee mean by some of their freedoms. Parry and I get on very
      well <i>hitherto</i>: how long this may last, Heaven knows, but I
      hope it will, for a good deal for the Greek service depends upon
      it; but he has already had some" <i>miffs</i> with Col. S. and I
      do all I can to keep the peace amongst them. However, Parry is a
      fine fellow, extremely active, and of strong, sound, practical
      talents, by all accounts. Enclosed are bills for three thousand

      him to me by a safe conveyance, as the papers regard a

      of several thousand pounds, which I, or my bankers and trustees
      for me, may have to receive (in England) in consequence. The time

    <p>
      How strong were the hopes which even those who watched him most
      observingly conceived from the whole tenor of his conduct since
      his arrival at Missolonghi, will appear from the following words
      of Colonel Stanhope, in one of his letters to the Greek
      Committee:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Byron possesses all the means of playing a great part in
      the glorious revolution of Greece. He has talent; he professes
      liberal principles; he has money, and is inspired with fervent
      and chivalrous feelings. He has commenced his career by two good
      measures: 1st, by recommending union, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg146" id="pg146">146</a></span> and declaring
      himself of no party; and, 2dly, by taking five hundred Suliotes
      into pay, and acting as their chief. These acts cannot fail to
      render his Lordship universally popular, and proportionally
      powerful. Thus advantageously circumstanced, his Lordship will
      have an opportunity of realising all his professions."
    </p>
    <p>
      That the inspirer, however, of these hopes was himself far from
      participating in them is a fact manifest from all he said and
      wrote on the subject, and but adds painfully to the interest
      which his position at this moment excites. Too well, indeed, did
      he both understand and feel the difficulties into which he was
      plunged to deceive himself into any such sanguine delusions. In
      one only of the objects to which he had looked forward with any
      hope,&mdash;that of endeavouring to humanise, by his example, the
      system of warfare on both sides,&mdash;had he yet been able to
      gratify himself. Not many days after his arrival an opportunity,
      as we have seen, had been afforded him of rescuing an unfortunate
      Turk out of the hands of some Greek sailors; and, towards the end
      of the month, having learned that there were a few Turkish
      prisoners in confinement at Missolonghi, he requested of the
      Government to place them at his disposal, that he might send them
      to Yussuff Pacha. In performing this act of humane policy, he
      transmitted with the rescued captives the following
      letter:&mdash; <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg147" id=

      "Missolonghi, January 23. 1824.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Highness!
    </p>
    <p>
      "A vessel, in which a friend and some domestics of mine were
      embarked, was detained a few days ago, and released by order of
      your Highness. I have now to thank you; not for liberating the
      vessel, which, as carrying a neutral flag, and being under
      British protection, no one had a right to detain; but for having
      treated my friends with so much kindness while they were in your
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the hope, therefore, that it may not be altogether
      displeasing to your Highness, I have requested the governor of
      this place to release four Turkish prisoners, and he has humanely
      consented to do so. I lose no time, therefore, in sending them
      back, in order to make as early a return as I could for your
      courtesy on the late occasion. These prisoners are liberated
      without any conditions: but should the circumstance find a place
      in your recollection, I venture to beg, that your Highness will
      treat such Greeks as may henceforth fall into your hands with
      humanity; more especially since the horrors of war are
      sufficiently great in themselves, without being aggravated by
      wanton cruelties on either side. NOEL BYRON."

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another favourite and, as it appeared for some time, practicable
      object, on which he had most ardently set his heart, was the
      intended attack upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg148" id=
      "pg148">148</a></span> Lepanto&mdash;a fortified town<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> which, from its command of the navigation of
      the Gulf of Corinth, is a position of the first importance. "Lord
      Byron," says Colonel Stanhope, in a letter dated January 14.,
      "burns with military ardour and chivalry, and will accompany the
      expedition to Lepanto." The delay of Parry, the engineer, who had
      been for some months anxiously expected with the supplies
      necessary for the formation of a brigade of artillery, had
      hitherto paralysed the preparations for this important
      enterprise; though, in the mean time, whatever little could be
      effected, without his aid, had been put in progress both by the
      appointment of a brigade of Suliotes to act under Lord Byron, and
      by the formation, at the joint expense of his Lordship and
      Colonel Stanhope, of a small corps of artillery.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: The ancient Naupactus, called Epacto by the modern
        Greeks, and Lepauto by the Italians.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It was towards the latter end of January, as we have seen, that
      Lord Byron received his regular commission from the Government,
      as Commander of the expedition. In conferring upon him full
      powers, both civil and military, they appointed, at the same
      time, a Military Council to accompany him, composed of the most
      experienced Chieftains of the army, with Nota Bozzari, the uncle
      of the famous warrior, at their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been expected that, among the stores sent with Parry,
      there would be a supply of Congreve rockets,&mdash;an instrument
      of warfare of which <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg149" id=
      "pg149">149</a></span> such wonders had been related to the
      Greeks as filled their imaginations with the most absurd ideas of
      its powers. Their disappointment, therefore, on finding that the
      engineer had come unprovided with these missiles was excessive.
      Another hope, too,&mdash;that of being enabled to complete an
      artillery corps by the accession of those Germans who had been
      sent for into the Morea,&mdash;was found almost equally
      fallacious; that body of men having, from the death or retirement
      of those who originally composed it, nearly dwindled away; and
      the few officers that now came to serve being, from their
      fantastic notions of rank and etiquette, far more troublesome
      than useful. In addition to these discouraging circumstances, the
      five Speziot ships of war which had for some time formed the sole
      protection of Missolonghi were now returned to their home, and
      had left their places to be filled by the enemy's squadron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexing as were all these difficulties in the way of the
      expedition, a still more formidable embarrassment presented
      itself in the turbulent and almost mutinous disposition of those
      Suliote troops on whom he mainly depended for success in his
      undertaking. Presuming as well upon his wealth and generosity as
      upon their own military importance, these unruly warriors had
      never ceased to rise in the extravagance of their demands upon
      him;&mdash;the wholly destitute and homeless state of their
      families at this moment affording but too well founded a pretext
      both for their exaction and discontent. Nor were their leaders
      much more amenable to management than themselves. "There were,"
      says Count Gamba, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg150" id=
      "pg150">150</a></span> "six heads of families among them, all of
      whom had equal pretensions both by their birth and their
      exploits; and none of whom would obey any one of his comrades."
    </p>
    <p>
      A serious riot to which, about the middle of January, these
      Suliotes had given rise, and in which some lives were lost, had
      been a source of much irritation and anxiety to Lord Byron, as
      well from the ill-blood it was likely to engender between his
      troops and the citizens, as from the little dependence it gave
      him encouragement to place upon materials so unmanageable.
      Notwithstanding all this, however, neither his eagerness nor his
      efforts for the accomplishment of this sole personal object of
      his ambition ever relaxed a single instant. To whatever little
      glory was to be won by the attack upon Lepanto, he looked forward
      as his only reward for all the sacrifices he was making. In his
      conversations with Count Gamba on the subject, "though he joked a
      good deal," says this gentleman, "about his post of
      'Archistrategos,' or Commander in Chief, it was plain that the
      romance and the peril of the undertaking were great allurements
      to him." When we combine, indeed, his determination to stand, at
      all hazards, by the cause, with the very faint hopes his
      sagacious mind would let him indulge as to his power of serving
      it, I have little doubt that the "soldier's grave" which, in his
      own beautiful verses, he marked out for himself, was no idle
      dream of poetry; but that, on the contrary, his "wish was father
      to the thought," and that to an honourable death, in some such
      achievement as that of storming <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg151" id="pg151">151</a></span> Lepanto, he looked forward, not
      only as the sole means of redeeming worthily the great pledge he
      had now given, but as the most signal and lasting service that a
      name like his,&mdash;echoed, as it would then be, among the
      watch-words of Liberty, from age to age,&mdash;could bequeath to
      her cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these cares he was much gratified by the receipt
      of a letter from an old friend of his, Andrea Londo, whom he had
      made acquaintance with in his early travels in 1809, and who was

      experienced from you during my stay in that country, of which you
      are now become one of the first defenders and ornaments. To see
      myself serving, by your side and under your eyes, in the cause of
      Greece, will be to me one of the happiest events of my life. In

      Among the less serious embarrassments of his position at this
      period, may be mentioned the struggle maintained against him by
      his colleague, Colonel Stanhope,&mdash;with a degree of
      conscientious perseverance which, even while thwarted by it, he
      could not but respect, on the subject of a Free Press, which it
      was one of the favourite objects of his fellow-agent to bring
      instantly into operation in all parts of Greece. On this
      important point their opinions differed considerably; and the
      following report, by Colonel Stanhope, of one of their many
      conversations on the subject, may be taken as a fair and concise
      statement of their respective views:&mdash;"Lord Byron said that
      he was an ardent friend of publicity and the press: but that he
      feared it was not applicable to this society in its present
      combustible state. I answered that I thought it applicable
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg153" id="pg153">153</a></span>
      to all countries, and essential here, in order to put an end to
      the state of anarchy which at present prevailed. Lord B. feared
      libels and licentiousness. I said that the object of a free press
      was to check public licentiousness, and to expose libellers to
      odium. Lord B. had mentioned his conversation with
      Mavrocordato<span class="fnref">[1]</span> to show that the
      Prince was not hostile to the press. I declared that I knew him
      to be an enemy to the press, although he dared not openly to avow
      it. His Lordship then said that he had not made up his mind about
      the liberty of the press in Greece, but that he thought the
      experiment worth trying."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Lord Byron had, it seems, acknowledged, on the
        preceding evening, his having remarked to Prince Blavrocordato
        that "if he were in his situation, he would have placed the
        press under a censor;" to which the Prince had replied, "No;
        the liberty of the press is guaranteed by the Constitution."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      That between two men, both eager in the service of one common
      cause, there should arise a difference of opinion as to the
      <i>means</i> of serving it is but a natural result of the
      varieties of human judgment, and detracts nothing from the zeal
      or sincerity of either. But by those who do not suffer themselves
      to be carried away by a theory, it will be conceded, I think,
      that the scruples professed by Lord Byron, with respect to the
      expedience or safety of introducing what is called a Free Press
      into a country so little advanced in civilisation as Greece, were
      founded on just views of human nature and practical good sense.
      To endeavour to force upon a state of society, so unprepared for
      them, such full grown institutions; to <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg154" id="pg154">154</a></span> think of
      engrafting, at once, on an ignorant people the fruits of long
      knowledge and cultivation,&mdash;of importing among them, ready
      made, those advantages and blessings which no nation ever
      attained but by its own working out, nor ever was fitted to enjoy
      but by having first struggled for them; to harbour even a dream
      of the success of such an experiment, implies a sanguineness
      almost incredible, and such as, though, in the present instance,
      indulged by the political economist and soldier, was, as we have
      seen, beyond the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiastic and, in many respects, well founded confidence
      with which Colonel Stanhope appealed to the authority of Mr.
      Bentham on most of the points at issue between himself and Lord
      Byron, was, from that natural antipathy which seems to exist
      between political economists and poets, but little sympathised in
      by the latter;&mdash;such appeals being always met by him with
      those sallies of ridicule, which he found the best-humoured vent
      for his impatience under argument, and to which, notwithstanding
      the venerable name and services of Mr. Bentham himself, the
      quackery of much that is promulgated by his followers presented,
      it must be owned, ample scope. Romantic, indeed, as was Lord
      Byron's sacrifice of himself to the cause of Greece, there was in
      the views he took of the means of serving her not a tinge of the
      unsubstantial or speculative. The grand practical task of freeing
      her from her tyrants was his first and main object. He knew that
      slavery was the great bar to knowledge, and must be broken
      through before her light could <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg155" id="pg155">155</a></span> come; that the work of the
      sword must therefore precede that of the pen, and camps be the
      first schools of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such sound and manly views of the true exigencies of the
      crisis, it is not wonderful that he should view with impatience,
      and something, perhaps, of contempt, all that premature apparatus
      of printing-presses, pedagogues, &amp;c. with which the
      Philhellenes of the London Committee were, in their rage for
      "utilitarianism," encumbering him. Nor were some of the
      correspondents of this body much more solid in their speculations
      than themselves; one intelligent gentleman having suggested, as a
      means of conferring signal advantages on the cause, an alteration
      of the Greek alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though feeling, as strongly, perhaps, as Lord Byron, the
      importance of the great object of their mission,&mdash;that of
      rousing and, what was far more difficult, combining against the
      common foe the energies of the country,&mdash;Colonel Stanhope
      was also one of those who thought that the lights of their great
      master, Bentham, and the operations of a press unrestrictedly
      free, were no less essential instruments towards the advancement
      of the struggle; and in this opinion, as we have seen, the poet
      and man of literature differed from the soldier. But it was such
      a difference as, between men of frank and fair minds, may arise
      without either reproach to themselves, or danger to their
      cause,&mdash;a strife of opinion which; though maintained with
      heat, may be remembered without bitterness, and which, in the
      present instance, neither prevented Byron, at the close of one
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg156" id="pg156">156</a></span>
      of their warmest altercations, from exclaiming generously to his
      opponent, "Give me that honest right hand," nor withheld the
      other from pouring forth, at the grave of his colleague, a strain
      of eulogy<span class="fnref">[1]</span> not the less cordial for
      being discriminatingly shaded with censure, nor less honourable
      to the illustrious dead for being the tribute of one who had once
      manfully differed with him.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Sketch of Lord Byron.&mdash;See Colonel Stanhope's
        "Greece in 1823, 1824," &amp;c.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Towards the middle of February, the indefatigable activity of Mr.
      Parry having brought the artillery brigade into such a state of
      forwardness as to be almost ready for service, an inspection of
      the Suliote corps took place, preparatory to the expedition; and
      after much of the usual deception and unmanageableness on their
      part, every obstacle appeared to be at length surmounted. It was
      agreed that they should receive a month's pay in
      advance;&mdash;Count Gamba, with 300 of their corps, as a
      vanguard, was to march next day and take up a position under
      Lepanto, and Lord Byron with the main body and the artillery was
      speedily to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      New difficulties, however, were soon started by these untractable
      mercenaries; and under the instigation, as was discovered
      afterwards, of the great rival of Mavrocordato, Colocotroni, who
      had sent emissaries into Missolonghi for the purpose of seducing
      them, they now put forward their exactions in a new shape, by
      requiring of the Government to appoint, out of their number, two
      generals, two colonels, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg157" id=
      "pg157">157</a></span> two captains, and inferior officers in the
      same proportion:&mdash;"in short," says Count Gamba, "that, out
      of three or four hundred actual Suliotes, there should be about
      one hundred and fifty above the rank of common soldiers." The
      audacious dishonesty of this demand,&mdash;beyond what he could
      have expected even from Greeks,&mdash;roused all Lord Byron's
      rage, and he at once signified to the whole body, through Count
      Gamba, that all negotiation between them and himself was at an
      end; that he could no longer have any confidence in persons so
      little true to their engagements; and that though the relief
      which he had afforded to their families should still be
      continued, all his agreements with them, as a body, must be
      thenceforward void.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the 14th of February that this rupture with the
      Suliotes took place; and though, on the following day, in
      consequence of the full submission of their Chiefs, they were
      again received into his Lordship's service on his own terms, the
      whole affair, combined with the various other difficulties that
      now beset him, agitated his mind considerably. He saw with pain
      that he should but place in peril both the cause of Greece and
      his own character, by at all relying, in such an enterprise, upon
      troops whom any intriguer could thus seduce from their duty; and
      that, till some more regular force could be organised, the
      expedition against Lepanto must be suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these vexatious events were occurring, the interruption of
      his accustomed exercise by the rains but increased the
      irritability that such delays were <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg158" id="pg158">158</a></span> calculated to excite; and the
      whole together, no doubt, concurred with whatever predisposing
      tendencies were already in his constitution, to bring on that
      convulsive fit,&mdash;the forerunner of his death,&mdash;which,
      on the evening of the 15th of February, seized him. He was
      sitting, at about eight o'clock, with only Mr. Parry and Mr.
      Hesketh, in the apartment of Colonel Stanhope,&mdash;talking
      jestingly upon one of his favourite topics, the differences
      between himself and this latter gentleman, and saying that "he
      believed, after all, the author's brigade would be ready before
      the soldier's printing-press." There was an unusual flush in his
      face, and from the rapid changes of his countenance it was
      manifest that he was suffering under some nervous agitation. He
      then complained of being thirsty, and, calling for some cider,
      drank of it; upon which, a still greater change being observable
      over his features, he rose from his seat, but was unable to walk,
      and, after staggering forward a step or two, fell into Mr.
      Parry's arms. In another minute, his teeth were closed, his
      speech and senses gone, and he was in strong convulsions. So
      violent, indeed, were his struggles, that it required all the
      strength both of Mr. Parry and his servant Tita to hold him
      during the fit. His face, too, was much distorted; and, as he
      told Count Gamba afterwards, "so intense were his sufferings
      during the convulsion, that, had it lasted but a minute longer,
      he believed he must have died." The fit was, however, as short as
      it was violent; in a few minutes his speech and senses returned;
      his features, though still pale and haggard, resumed their
      natural shape, and no effect remained from the attack but
      excessive <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg159" id=
      "pg159">159</a></span> weakness. "As soon as he could speak,"
      says Count Gamba, "he showed himself perfectly free from all
      alarm; but he very coolly asked whether his attack was likely to
      prove fatal. 'Let me know,' he said; 'do not think I am afraid to
      die&mdash;I am not.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      This painful event had not occurred more than half an hour, when
      a report was brought that the Suliotes were up in arms, and about
      to attack the seraglio, for the purpose of seizing the magazines.
      Instantly Lord Byron's friends ran to the arsenal; the
      artillery-men were ordered under arms; the sentinels doubled, and
      the cannon loaded and pointed on the approaches to the gates.
      Though the alarm proved to be false, the very likelihood of such
      an attack shows sufficiently how precarious was the state of
      Missolonghi at this moment, and in what a scene of peril,
      confusion, and uncomfort, the now nearly numbered days of
      England's poet were to close.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning he was found to be better, but still
      pale and weak, and complained much of a sensation of weight in
      his head. The doctors, therefore, thought it right to apply
      leeches to his temples; but found it difficult, on their removal,
      to stop the blood, which continued to flow so copiously, that
      from exhaustion he fainted. It must have been on this day that
      the scene thus described by Colonel Stanhope occurred:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon after his dreadful paroxysm, when, faint with
      over-bleeding, he was lying on his sick bed, with his whole
      nervous system completely shaken, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg160" id="pg160">160</a></span> the mutinous Suliotes, covered
      with dirt and splendid attires, broke into his apartment,
      brandishing their costly arms, and loudly demanding their wild
      rights. Lord Byron, electrified by this unexpected act, seemed to
      recover from his sickness; and the more the Suliotes raged, the
      more his calm courage triumphed. The scene was truly sublime."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another eye-witness, Count Gamba, bears similar testimony to the
      presence of mind with which he fronted this and all other such
      dangers. "It is impossible," says this gentleman, "to do justice
      to the coolness and magnanimity which he displayed upon every
      trying occasion. Upon trifling occasions he was certainly
      irritable; but the aspect of danger calmed him in an instant, and
      restored to him the free exercise of all the powers of his noble
      nature. A more undaunted man in the hour of peril never
      breathed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters written by him during the few following weeks form,
      as usual, the best record of his proceedings, and, besides the
      sad interest they possess as being among the latest from his
      hand, are also precious, as affording proof that neither illness
      nor disappointment, neither a worn-out frame nor even a hopeless
      spirit, could lead him for a moment to think of abandoning the
      great cause he had espoused; while to the last, too, he preserved
      unbroken the cheerful spring of his mind, his manly endurance of
      all ills that affected but himself, and his ever-wakeful
      consideration for the wants of others. <span class=

      it.' I dare say you do not, nor anybody else, I should think.
      Whoever asserts that I am the author or abettor of any thing of

      whether it was epilepsy, catalepsy, cachexy, or apoplexy, or what
      other <i>exy</i> or <i>epsy</i>, the doctors have not decided; or
      whether it was spasmodic or nervous, &amp;c.; but it was very
      unpleasant, and nearly carried me off, and all that. On Monday,
      they put leeches to my temples, no difficult matter, but the
      blood could not be stopped till eleven at night (they had gone

        country, no home for their families; arrears of pay are owing
        to them; the people of Missolonghi hate and pay them
        exorbitantly. Lord Byron, who was to have led them to Lepanto,
        is much shaken by his fit, and will probably be obliged to
        retire from Greece. In short, all our hopes in this quarter are
        damped for the present. I am not a little fearful, too, that
        these wild warriors will not forget the blood that has been

      effected. The advance of a month's pay by him, and the discharge
      of their arrears by the Government, (the latter, too, with money
      lent for that purpose by the same universal paymaster,) at length

    <p>
      "My dear Moore,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your reproach is unfounded&mdash;I have received two letters
      from you, and answered both previous to leaving Cephalonia. I
      have not been 'quiet' in an Ionian island, but much occupied with
      business,&mdash;as the Greek deputies (if arrived) can tell you.
      Neither have I continued 'Don Juan,' nor any other poem. You go,
      as usual, I presume, by some newspaper report or
      other.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Proceeding, as he here rightly supposes, upon
        newspaper authority, I had in my letter made some allusion to
        his imputed occupations, which, in his present sensitiveness on
        the subject of authorship, did not at all please him. To this
        circumstance Count Gamba alludes in a passage of his Narrative;
        where, after mentioning a remark of Byron's, that "Poetry
        should only occupy the idle, and that in more serious affairs
        it would be ridiculous," he adds&mdash; "&mdash;&mdash;, at
        this time writing to him, said, that he had heard that 'instead
        of pursuing heroic and warlike adventures, he was residing in a
        delightful villa, continuing Don Juan.' This offended him for
        the moment, and he was sorry that such a mistaken judgment had
        been formed of him."
      </p>
      <p>
        It is amusing to observe that, while thus anxious, and from a
        highly noble motive, to throw his authorship into the shade
        while engaged in so much more serious pursuits, it was yet an
        author's mode of revenge that always occurred to him, when
        under the influence of any of these passing resentments. Thus,
        when a little angry with Colonel Stanhope one day, he
        exclaimed, "I will libel you in your own Chronicle;" and in
        this brief burst of humour I was myself the means of provoking
        in him, I have been told, on the authority of Count Gamba, that
        he swore to "write a satire" upon me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the above letter shows how momentary was any little
        spleen he may have felt, there not unfrequently, I own, comes
        over me a short pang of regret to think that a feeling of
        displeasure, however slight, should have been among the latest
        I awakened in him.]

      "When the proper moment to be of some use arrived, I came here;
      and am told that my arrival (with some other circumstances)
      <i>has</i> been of, at least, temporary advantage to the cause. I
      had a narrow escape from the Turks, and another from Shipwreck on
      my passage. On the 15th (or 16th) of February I had an attack of
      apoplexy, or epilepsy,&mdash;the physicians have not exactly
      decided which, but the alternative is agreeable. My constitution,
      therefore, remains between the two opinions, like Mahomet's
      sarcophagus between the magnets. All that I can say is, that they
      nearly bled me to death, by placing the leeches too near the
      temporal artery, so that the blood could with difficulty be
      stopped, even with caustic, I am supposed to be getting better,
      slowly, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg171" id=

      'kill a man a week,' like Bob Acres in the country. Parry's
      artificers have gone away in alarm, on account of a dispute in
      which some of the natives and foreigners were engaged, and a
      Swede was killed, and a Suliote wounded. In the middle of their
      fright there was a strong shock of an earthquake; so, between
      that and the sword, they boomed off in a hurry, in despite of all
      dissuasions to the contrary. A Turkish brig run ashore, &amp;c.

      "I have to thank you for your two very kind letters, both
      received at the same time, and one long after its date. I am not
      unaware of the precarious state of my health, nor am, nor have
      been, deceived on that subject. But it is proper that I should
      remain in Greece; and it were better to die doing something than
      nothing. My presence here has been supposed so far useful as to
      have prevented confusion from becoming worse confounded, at least
      for the present. Should I become, or be deemed useless or
      superfluous, I am ready to retire; but in the interim I am not to
      consider personal consequences; the rest is in the hands of
      Providence,&mdash;as indeed are all things. I shall, however,
      observe your instructions, and indeed did so, as far as regards
      abstinence, for some time past.

    <p>
      "Besides the tracts, &amp;c. which you have sent for
      distribution, one of the English artificers (hight Brownbill, a
      tinman,) left to my charge a number of Greek Testaments, which I
      will endeavour to distribute properly. The Greeks complain that
      the translation is not correct, nor in <i>good</i> Romaic: Bambas
      can decide on that point. I am trying to reconcile the clergy to
      the distribution, which (without due regard to their hierarchy)
      they might contrive to impede or neutralise in the effect, from
      their power over their people. Mr. Brownbill has gone to the
      Islands, having some apprehension for his life, (not <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg173" id="pg173">173</a></span> from the
      priests, however,) and apparently preferring rather to be a saint
      than a martyr, although his apprehensions of becoming the latter
      were probably unfounded. All the English artificers accompanied
      him, thinking themselves in danger on account of some troubles
      here, which have apparently subsided.
    </p>

      "I have been interrupted by a visit from Prince Mavrocordato and
      others since I began this letter, and must close it hastily, for
      the boat is announced as ready to sail. Your future convert,
      Hato, or Hatagée, appears to me lively, and intelligent, and
      promising, and possesses an interesting countenance. With regard
      to her disposition, I can say little, but Millingen, who has the
      mother (who is a middle-aged woman of good character) in his
      house as a domestic (although their family was in good worldly
      circumstances previous to the Revolution), speaks well of both,
      and he is to be relied on. As far as I know, I have only seen the
      child a few times with her mother, and what I have seen is
      favourable, or I should not take so much interest in her behalf.
      If she turns out well, my idea would be to send her to my
      daughter in England (if not to respectable persons in Italy), and
      so to provide for her as to enable her to live with reputation
      either singly or in marriage, if she arrive at maturity. I will
      make proper arrangements about her expenses through Messrs. Barff

        who kept the accounts of his Lordship's disbursements, "the
        expenses of Lord Byron in the cause of the Greeks did not
        amount to less than two thousand dollars per week in rations
        alone." In another place this writer says, "The Greeks seemed
        to think he was a mine from which they could extract gold at
        their pleasure. One person represented that a supply of 20,000
        dollars would save the island of Candia from falling into the
        hands of the Pacha of Egypt; and there not being that sum in
        hand, Lord Byron gave him authority to raise it if he could in
        the Islands, and he would guarantee its repayment. I believe
        this person did not succeed."]

      The letter of Parruca, to which the foregoing alludes, contained
      a pressing invitation to Lord Byron to present himself in the
      Peloponnesus, where, it was added, his influence would be sure to
      bring about the Union of all parties. So general, indeed, was the
      confidence placed in their noble ally, that, by every Chief of
      every faction, he seems to have been regarded as the only
      rallying point round which there was the slightest chance of
      their now split and jarring interests being united. A far more
      flattering, as well as more authorised, invitation soon after
      reached him, through an express envoy, from the Chieftain,
      Colocotroni, recommending a National Council, where his Lordship,
      it was proposed, should act as mediator, and pledging this Chief
      himself and his followers to abide by the result. To this
      application an answer was returned similar to that which he sent
      to Parruca, and which was in terms as follows:&mdash;

      raise some thousand dollars in the islands in the interim, to be
      repaid from the earliest instalments on their arrival. What
      prospect of success they may have, or on what conditions, you can
      tell better than me: I suppose, if the Loan be confirmed,
      something might be done by them, but subject of course to the
      usual terms. You can let them and me know your opinion. There is
      an imperious necessity for some national fund, and that speedily,

      hundred men, paid by me, are, I believe, the sole regularly and
      properly furnished with the money, due to them weekly, and the
      officers monthly. It is true that the Greek Government give their
      rations; but we have had three mutinies, owing to the badness of

      any length, or in detail. After the failure of his design against
      Lepanto, the two great objects of his daily thoughts were, the
      repairs of the fortifications of Missolonghi <span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, and the formation of a brigade;&mdash;the
      one, with a view to such defensive measures as were alone likely
      to be called for during the present campaign; and the other in
      preparation for those more active enterprises, which he still
      fondly flattered himself he should undertake in the next. "He
      looked forward (says Mr. Parry) for the recovery of his health
      and spirits, to the return of the fine weather, and the
      commencement of the campaign, when he proposed to take the field
      at the head of his own brigade, and the troops which the
      Government of Greece were to place under his orders."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: The generous zeal with which he applied himself to
        this important object will be understood from the following
        statement:&mdash;"On reporting to Lord Byron what I thought
        might be done, he ordered me to draw up a plan for putting the
        fortifications in thorough repair, and to accompany it with an
        estimate of the expense. It was agreed that I should make the
        estimate only one third of what I thought would be the actual
        expense; and if that third could be procured from the
        magistrates, Lord Byron undertook secretly to pay the
        remainder."]

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg188" id=

      With that thanklessness which too often waits on disinterested
      actions, it has been sometimes tauntingly remarked, and in
      quarters from whence a more generous judgment might be expected
      <span class="fnref">[1]</span>, that, after all, Lord Byron
      effected but little for Greece:&mdash;as if much <i>could</i> be
      effected by a single individual, and in so short a time, for a
      cause which, fought as it has been almost incessantly through the
      six years since his death, has required nothing less than the
      intervention of all the great Powers of Europe to give it a
      chance of success, and, even so, has not yet succeeded. That
      Byron himself was under no delusion as to the importance of his
      own solitary aid,&mdash;that he knew, in a struggle like this,
      there must be the same prodigality of means towards one great end
      as is observable in the still grander operations of nature, where
      individuals are as nothing in the tide of events,&mdash;that such
      was his, at once, philosophic and melancholy view of his own
      sacrifices, I have, I trust, clearly shown. But that, during this
      short period of action, he did not do well and wisely all that
      man could achieve in the time, and under the circumstances, is an
      assertion which the noble facts here recorded fully and
      triumphantly disprove. He knew that, placed as he was, his
      measures, to be wise, must be prospective, and from the nature of
      the seeds thus sown by him, the benefits that were to be expected
      must be judged. To reconcile the rude chiefs to the Government
      and to each other;&mdash;to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg189"
      id="pg189">189</a></span> infuse a spirit of humanity, by his
      example, into their warfare;&mdash;to prepare the way for the
      employment of the expected Loan, in a manner most calculated to
      call forth the resources of the country;&mdash;to put the
      fortifications of Missolonghi in such a state of repair as might,
      and eventually <i>did</i>, render it proof against the
      besieger;&mdash;to prevent those infractions of neutrality, so
      tempting to the Greeks, which brought their Government in
      collision with the Ionian authorities<span class=
      "fnref">[2]</span>, and to restrain all such license of the Press
      as might indispose the Courts of Europe to their
      cause:&mdash;such were the important objects which he had
      proposed to himself to accomplish, and towards which, in this
      brief interval, and in the midst of such dissensions and
      hinderances, he had already made considerable and most promising
      progress. But it would be unjust to close even here the bright
      catalogue of his services. It is, after all, <i>not</i> with the
      span of mortal life that the good achieved by a name immortal
      ends. The charm acts into the future,&mdash;it is an auxiliary
      through all time; and the inspiring example of Byron, as a martyr
      of liberty, is for ever freshly embalmed in his glory as a poet.
      From the period of his attack in February he had <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg190" id="pg190">190</a></span> been, from
      time to time, indisposed; and, more than once, had complained of
      vertigos, which made him feel, he said, as if intoxicated. He was
      also frequently affected with nervous sensations, with shiverings
      and tremors, which, though apparently the effects of excessive
      debility, he himself attributed to fulness of habit. Proceeding
      upon this notion, he had, ever since his arrival in Greece,
      abstained almost wholly from animal food, and ate of little else
      but dry toast, vegetables, and cheese. With the same fear of
      becoming fat, which had in his young days haunted him, he almost
      every morning measured himself round the wrist and waist, and
      whenever he found these parts, as he thought, enlarged, took a
      strong dose of medicine.

        [Footnote 2: In a letter which he addressed to Lord Sidney
        Osborne, enclosing one, on the subject of these infractions,
        from Prince Mavrocordato to Sir T. Maitland, Lord Byron
        says,&mdash;"You must all be persuaded how difficult it is,
        under existing circumstances, for the Greeks to keep up
        discipline, however they may be all disposed to do so, I am
        doing all I can to convince them of the necessity of the
        strictest observance of the regulations of the Islands, and, I
        trust, with some effect"]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Exertions had, as we have seen, been made by his friends at
      Cephalonia, to induce him, without delay, to return to that
      island, and take measures, while there was yet time, for the
      re-establishment of his health. "But these entreaties (says Count
      Gamba) produced just the contrary effect; for in proportion as
      Byron thought his position more perilous, he the more resolved
      upon remaining where he was." In the midst of all this, too, the
      natural flow of his spirits in society seldom deserted him; and
      whenever a trick upon any of his attendants, or associates,
      suggested itself, he was as ready to play the mischief-loving boy
      as ever. His engineer, Parry, having been much alarmed by the
      earthquake they had experienced, and still continuing in constant
      apprehension of its return, Lord Byron contrived, as they were
      all sitting together one evening, to have <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg191" id="pg191">191</a></span> some barrels
      full of cannon-balls trundled through the room above them; and
      laughed heartily, as he would have done when a Harrow boy, at the
      ludicrous effect which this deception produced on the poor
      frightened engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day, however, brought new trials both to his health and
      temper. The constant rains had rendered the swamps of Missolonghi
      almost impassable;&mdash;an alarm of plague, which, about the
      middle of March, was circulated, made it prudent, for some time,
      to keep within doors; and he was thus, week after week, deprived
      of his accustomed air and exercise. The only recreation he had
      recourse to was that of playing with his favourite dog, Lion;
      and, in the evening, going through the exercise of drilling with
      his officers, or practising at single-stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, the demands upon his exertions, personal and
      pecuniary, poured in from all sides, while the embarrassments of
      his public position every day increased. The chief obstacle in
      the way of his plan for the reconciliation of all parties had
      been the rivalry so long existing between Mavrocordato and the
      Eastern Chiefs; and this difficulty was now not a little
      heightened by the part taken by Colonel Stanhope and Mr.
      Trelawney, who, having allied themselves with Odysseus, the most
      powerful of these Chieftains, were endeavouring actively to
      detach Lord Byron from Mavrocordato, and enlist him in their own
      views. This schism was,&mdash;to say the least of
      it,&mdash;ill-timed and unfortunate. For, as Prince Mavrocordato
      and Lord Byron were now acting in complete harmony with the
      Government, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg192" id=
      "pg192">192</a></span> a co-operation of all the other English
      agents on the same side would have had the effect of assuring a
      preponderance to this party (which was that of the civil and
      commercial interests all through Greece), that might, by
      strengthening the hands of the ruling power, have afforded some
      hope of vigour and consistency in its movements. By this
      division, however, the English lost their casting weight; and not
      only marred whatever little chance they might have had of
      extinguishing the dissensions of the Greeks, but exhibited, most
      unseasonably, an example of dissension among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit to Salona, in which, though distrustful of the intended
      Military Congress, Mavrocordato had consented to accompany Lord
      Byron, was, as the foregoing letters have mentioned, delayed by
      the floods,&mdash;the river Fidari having become so swollen as
      not to be fordable. In the mean time, dangers, both from within
      and without, threatened Missolonghi. The Turkish fleet had again
      come forth from the Gulf, while, in concert, it was apprehended,
      with this resumption of the blockade, insurrectionary movements,
      instigated, as was afterwards known, by the malcontents of the
      Morea, manifested themselves formidably both in the town and its
      neighbourhood. The first cause for alarm was the landing, in
      canoes, from Anatolico, of a party of armed men, the followers of
      Cariascachi of that place, who came to demand retribution from
      the people of Missolonghi for some injury that, in a late affray,
      had been inflicted on one of their clan. It was also rumoured
      that 300 Suliotes were marching upon the town; and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg193" id="pg193">193</a></span> the following
      morning, news came that a party of these wild warriors had
      actually seized upon Basiladi, a fortress that commands the port
      of Missolonghi, while some of the soldiers of Cariascachi had, in
      the course of the night, arrested two of the Primates, and
      carried them to Anatolico. The tumult and indignation that this
      intelligence produced was universal. All the shops were shut, and
      the bazaars deserted. "Lord Byron," says Count Gamba, "ordered
      his troops to continue under arms; but to preserve the strictest
      neutrality, without mixing in any quarrel, either by actions or
      words."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this crisis, the weather had become sufficiently
      favourable to admit of his paying the visit to Salona, which he
      had purposed. But, as his departure at such a juncture might have
      the appearance of abandoning Missolonghi, he resolved to wait the
      danger out. At this time the following letters were written.

      "There is a quarrel, not yet settled, between the citizens and
      some of Cariascachi's people, which has already produced some
      blows. I keep my people quite neutral; but have ordered them to
      be on their guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some days ago we had an Italian private soldier drummed out for
      thieving. The German officers wanted to flog him; but I flatly
      refused to permit the use of the stick or whip, and delivered him
      over <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg194" id=
      "pg194">194</a></span> to the police.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> Since then a Prussian officer rioted in his
      lodgings; and I put him under arrest, according to the order.
      This, it appears, did not please his German confederation: but I
      stuck by my text; and have given them plainly to understand, that
      those who do not choose to be amenable to the laws of the country
      and service, may retire; but that in all that I have to do, I
      will see them obeyed by foreigner or native.

        concerned, no barbarous usages, however adopted even by some
        civilised people, should be introduced into Greece; especially
        as such a mode of punishment would disgust rather than reform.
        We hit upon an expedient which favoured our military
        discipline: but it required not only all Lord Byron's
        eloquence, but his authority, to prevail upon our Germans to
        accede to it. The culprit had his uniform stripped off his
        back, in presence of his comrades, and was afterwards marched
        through the town with a label on his back, describing, both in
        Greek and Italian, the nature of his offence; after which he
        was given up to the regular police. This example of severity,
        tempered by a humane spirit, produced the best effect upon our
        soldiers, as well as upon the citizens of the town. But it was
        very near causing a most disagreeable circumstance; for, in the
        course of the evening, some very high words passed on the
        subject between three Englishmen, two of them officers of our
        brigade, in consequence of which cards were exchanged, and two
        duels were to have been fought the next morning. Lord Byron did
        not hear of this till late at night: but he immediately ordered
        me to arrest both parties, which I according did; and, after
        some difficulty, prevailed on them to shake hands."&mdash;COUNT

      excursion into the country. To-day matters are settled or
      subsiding; but, about an hour ago, the father-in-law of the

        ever since his arrival at Missolonghi, kept about him as a
        body-guard. A large outer room of his house was appropriated to
        these troops; and their carbines were suspended along the
        walls. "In this room (says Mr. Parry), and among these rude

        When he rode out, these fifty Suliotes attended him on foot;

        Lordship, who rode accompanied on one side by Count Gamba, and
        on the other by the Greek interpreter. Behind him, also on
        horseback, came two of his servants,&mdash;generally his black

      while we contemplate this last scene of his life, that, much as
      there is in it to admire, to wonder at, and glory in, there is
      also much that awakens sad and most distressful thoughts. In a

      coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who have, from his childhood, traced him through these
      pages, it must be manifest, I think, that Lord Byron was not
      formed to be long-lived. Whether from any hereditary defect in
      his organisation,&mdash;as he himself, from the circumstance of
      both his parents having died young, concluded,&mdash;or from
      those violent means he so early took to counteract the natural
      tendency of his habit, and reduce himself to thinness, he was,
      almost every year, as we have seen, subject to attacks of
      indisposition, by more than one of which his life was seriously
      endangered. The capricious course which he at all times pursued
      respecting diet,&mdash;his long fastings, his expedients for the
      allayment of hunger, his occasional excesses in the most
      unwholesome food, and, during the latter part of his residence in
      Italy, his indulgence in the use of spirituous
      beverages,&mdash;all this could not be otherwise than hurtful and
      undermining to his health; while his constant recourse to
      medicine,&mdash;daily, as it appears, and in large
      quantities,&mdash;both evinced and, no doubt, increased the
      derangement of his digestion. When to all this we add the
      wasteful wear of spirits and strength from the slow corrosion of
      sensibility, the warfare of the passions, and the workings of a
      mind that allowed itself no sabbath, it is not to be wondered at
      that the vital principle in him should so soon have burnt out, or
      that, at the age of thirty-three, he should have had&mdash;as he
      himself drearily <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg200" id=
      "pg200">200</a></span> expresses it&mdash;"an old feel." To feed
      the flame, the all-absorbing flame, of his genius, the whole
      powers of his nature, physical as well as moral, were
      sacrificed;&mdash;to present that grand and costly conflagration
      to the world's eyes, in which,

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It was on the very day when, as I have mentioned, the
      intelligence of his sister's recovery reached him, that, having
      been for the last three or four days prevented from taking
      exercise by the rains, he resolved, though the weather still
      looked threatening, to venture out on horseback. Three miles from
      Missolonghi Count Gamba and himself were overtaken by a heavy
      shower, and returned to the town walls wet through and in a state
      of violent perspiration. It had been their usual practice to
      dismount at the walls and return to their house in a boat, but,
      on this day, Count Gamba, representing to Lord Byron how
      dangerous it would be, warm as he then was, to sit exposed so
      long to the rain in a boat, entreated of him to go back the whole
      way on horseback. To this however, Lord Byron would not consent;
      but said, laughingly, "I should make a pretty soldier indeed, if
      I were to care for such a trifle." They accordingly dismounted
      and got into the boat as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two hours after his return home he was seized with a
      shuddering, and complained of fever and rheumatic pains. "At
      eight that evening," <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg201" id=
      "pg201">201</a></span> says Count Gamba, "I entered his room. He
      was lying on a sofa restless and melancholy. He said to me, 'I
      suffer a great deal of pain. I do not care for death, but these
      agonies I cannot bear.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day he rose at his accustomed
      hour,&mdash;transacted business, and was even able to take his
      ride in the olive woods, accompanied, as usual, by his long train
      of Suliotes. He complained, however, of perpetual shudderings,
      and had no appetite. On his return home he remarked to Fletcher
      that his saddle, he thought, had not been perfectly dried since
      yesterday's wetting, and that he felt himself the worse for it.
      This was the last time he ever crossed the threshold alive. In
      the evening Mr. Finlay and Mr. Millingen called upon him. "He was
      at first (says the latter gentleman) gayer than usual; but on a
      sudden became pensive."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 11th his fever, which was pronounced to be
      rheumatic, increased; and on the 12th he kept his bed all day,
      complaining that he could not sleep, and taking no nourishment
      whatever. The two following days, though the fever had apparently
      diminished, he became still more weak, and suffered much from
      pains in the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the 14th that his physician, Dr. Bruno, finding
      the sudorifics which he had hitherto employed to be unavailing,
      began to urge upon his patient the necessity of being bled. Of
      this, however, Lord Byron would not hear. He had evidently but
      little reliance on his medical attendant; and from the specimens
      this young man has since given of his intellect to the world, it
      is, indeed, lamentable,&mdash;supposing <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg202" id="pg202">202</a></span> skill to have
      been, at this moment, of any avail,&mdash;that a life so precious
      should have been intrusted to such ordinary hands. "It was on
      this day, I think," says Count Gamba, "that, as I was sitting
      near him, on his sofa, he said to me, 'I was afraid I was losing
      my memory, and, in order to try, I attempted to repeat some Latin
      verses with the English translation, which I have not endeavoured
      to recollect since I was at school. I remembered them all except
      the last word of one of the hexameters.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      To the faithful Fletcher, the idea of his master's life being in
      danger seems to have occurred some days before it struck either
      Count Gamba or the physician. So little, according to his
      friend's narrative, had such a suspicion crossed Lord Byron's own
      mind, that he even expressed himself "rather glad of his fever,
      as it might cure him of his tendency to epilepsy." To Fletcher,
      however, it appears, he had professed, more than once, strong
      doubts as to the nature of his complaint being so slight as the
      physician seemed to suppose it, and on his servant renewing his
      entreaties that he would send for Dr. Thomas to Zante, made no
      further opposition; though still, out of consideration for those
      gentlemen, he referred him on the subject to Dr. Bruno and Mr.
      Millingen. Whatever might have been the advantage or satisfaction
      of this step, it was now rendered wholly impossible by the
      weather,&mdash;such a hurricane blowing into the port that not a
      ship could get out. The rain, too, descended in torrents, and
      between the floods on the land-side and the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg203" id="pg203">203</a></span> sirocco from
      the sea, Missolonghi was, for the moment, a pestilential prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture that Mr. Millingen was, for the first
      time, according to his own account, invited to attend Lord Byron
      in his medical capacity,&mdash;his visit on the 10th being so
      little, as he states, professional, that he did not even, on that
      occasion, feel his Lordship's pulse. The great object for which
      he was now called in, and rather, it would seem, by Fletcher than
      Dr. Bruno, was for the purpose of joining his representations and
      remonstrances to theirs, and prevailing upon the patient to
      suffer himself to be bled,&mdash;an operation now become
      absolutely necessary from the increase of the fever, and which
      Dr. Bruno had, for the last two days, urged in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding gentleness to be, with a disposition like that of Byron,
      the most effectual means of success, Mr. Millingen tried, as he
      himself tells us, all that reasoning and persuasion could suggest
      towards attaining his object. But his efforts were
      fruitless:&mdash;Lord Byron, who had now become morbidly
      irritable, replied angrily, but still with all his accustomed
      acuteness and spirit, to the physician's observations. Of all his
      prejudices, he declared, the strongest was that against bleeding.
      His mother had obtained from him a promise never to consent to
      being bled; and whatever argument might be produced, his
      aversion, he said, was stronger than reason. "Besides, is it
      not," he asked, "asserted by Dr. Reid, in his Essays, that less
      slaughter is effected by the lance than the lancet:&mdash;that
      minute instrument of mighty <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg204"
      id="pg204">204</a></span> mischief!" On Mr. Millingen observing
      that this remark related to the treatment of nervous, but not of
      inflammatory complaints, he rejoined, in an angry tone, "Who is
      nervous, if I am not? And do not those other words of his, too,
      apply to my case, where he says that drawing blood from a nervous
      patient is like loosening the chords of a musical instrument,
      whose tones already fail for want of sufficient tension? Even
      before this illness, you yourself know how weak and irritable I
      had become;&mdash;and bleeding, by increasing this state, will
      inevitably kill me. Do with me whatever else you like, but bleed
      me you shall not. I have had several inflammatory fevers in my
      life, and at an age when more robust and plethoric: yet I got
      through them without bleeding. This time, also, will I take my
      chance."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: It was during the same, or some similar
        conversation, that Dr. Bruno also reports him to have said, "If
        my hour is come, I shall die, whether I lose my blood or keep
        it."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      After much reasoning and repeated entreaties, Mr. Millingen at
      length succeeded in obtaining from him a promise, that should he
      feel his fever increase at night, he would allow Dr. Bruno to
      bleed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this day he had transacted business and received several
      letters; particularly one that much pleased him from the Turkish
      Governor, to whom he had sent the rescued prisoners, and who, in
      this communication, thanked him for his humane interference, and
      requested a repetition of it. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg205" id="pg205">205</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he conversed a good deal with Parry, who remained
      some hours by his bedside. "He sat up in his bed (says this
      officer), and was then calm and collected. He talked with me on a
      variety of subjects connected with himself and his family; he
      spoke of his intentions as to Greece, his plans for the campaign,
      and what he should ultimately do for that country. He spoke to me
      about my own adventures. He spoke of death also with great
      composure; and though he did not believe his end was so very
      near, there was something about him so serious and so firm, so
      resigned and composed, so different from any thing I had ever
      before seen in him, that my mind misgave me, and at times
      foreboded his speedy dissolution."
    </p>
    <p>
      On revisiting his patient early next morning, Mr. Millingen
      learned from him, that having passed, as he thought, on the
      whole, a better night, he had not considered it necessary to ask
      Dr. Bruno to bleed him. What followed, I shall, in justice to Mr.
      Millingen, give in his own words.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
      "I thought it my duty now to put aside all consideration of his
      feelings, and to declare solemnly to him, how deeply I lamented
      to see him trifle thus with his life, and show so little
      resolution. His pertinacious refusal had already, I said, caused
      most precious time to be lost;&mdash;but few hours of hope now
      remained, and, unless he submitted immediately to be bled, we
      could not answer for the consequences. It was true, he cared
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg206" id="pg206">206</a></span>
      not for life; but who could assure him that, unless he changed
      his resolution, the uncontrolled disease might not operate such
      disorganisation in his system as utterly and for ever to deprive
      him of reason?&mdash;I had now hit at last on the sensible chord;
      and, partly annoyed by our importunities, partly persuaded, he
      cast at us both the fiercest glance of vexation, and throwing out
      his arm, said, in the angriest tone, 'There,&mdash;you are, I
      see, a d&mdash;d set of butchers,&mdash;take away as much blood
      as you like, but have done with it.'
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: MS.&mdash;This gentleman is, I understand, about
        to publish the Narrative from which the above extract is
        taken.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "We seized the moment (adds Mr. Millingen), and drew about twenty
      ounces. On coagulating, the blood presented a strong buffy coat;
      yet the relief obtained did not correspond to the hopes we had
      formed, and during the night the fever became stronger than it
      had been hitherto. The restlessness and agitation increased, and
      the patient spoke several times in an incoherent manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, the 17th, the bleeding was repeated;
      for, although the rheumatic symptoms had been completely removed,
      the appearances of inflammation on the brain were now hourly
      increasing. Count Gamba, who had not for the last two days seen
      him, being confined to his own apartment by a sprained ankle, now
      contrived to reach his room. "His countenance," says this
      gentleman, "at once awakened in me the most dreadful suspicions.
      He was very calm; he talked to me in the kindest manner about my
      accident, but in a hollow, sepulchral tone. 'Take care of your
      foot,' said he; 'I know by experience how painful it must be.' I
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg207" id="pg207">207</a></span>
      could not stay near his bed: a flood of tears rushed into my
      eyes, and I was obliged to withdraw." Neither Count Gamba,
      indeed, nor Fletcher, appear to have been sufficiently masters of
      themselves to do much else than weep during the remainder of this
      afflicting scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the bleeding, which was repeated twice on the
      17th, it was thought right also to apply blisters to the soles of
      his feet. "When on the point of putting them on," says Mr.
      Millingen, "Lord Byron asked me whether it would answer the
      purpose to apply both on the same leg. Guessing immediately the
      motive that led him to ask this question, I told him that I would
      place them above the knees. 'Do so,' he replied."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is painful to dwell on such details,&mdash;but we are now
      approaching the close. In addition to most of those sad varieties
      of wretchedness which surround alike the grandest and humblest
      deathbeds, there was also in the scene now passing around the
      dying Byron such a degree of confusion and uncomfort as renders
      it doubly dreary to contemplate. There having been no person
      invested, since his illness, with authority over the household,
      neither order nor quiet was maintained in his apartment. Most of
      the comforts necessary in such an illness were wanting; and those
      around him, either unprepared for the danger, were, like Bruno,
      when it came, bewildered by it; or, like the kind-hearted
      Fletcher and Count Gamba, were by their feelings rendered no less
      helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In all the attendants," says Parry, "there was <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg208" id="pg208">208</a></span> the
      officiousness of zeal; but, owing to their ignorance of each
      other's language, their zeal only added to the confusion. This
      circumstance, and the want of common necessaries, made Lord
      Byron's apartment such a picture of distress and even anguish
      during the two or three last days of his life, as I never before
      beheld, and wish never again to witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The 18th being Easter day,&mdash;a holiday which the Greeks
      celebrate by firing off muskets and artillery,&mdash;it was
      apprehended that this noise might be injurious to Lord Byron;
      and, as a means of attracting away the crowd from the
      neighbourhood, the artillery brigade were marched out by Parry,
      to exercise their guns at some distance from the town; while, at
      the same time, the town-guard patrolled the streets, and
      informing the people of the danger of their benefactor, entreated
      them to preserve all possible quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o'clock in the afternoon, Lord Byron rose and went
      into the adjoining room. He was able to walk across the chamber,
      leaning on his servant Tita; and, when seated, asked for a book,
      which the servant brought him. After reading, however, for a few
      minutes, he found himself faint; and, again taking Tita's arm,
      tottered into the next room, and returned to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the physicians, becoming still more alarmed,
      expressed a wish for a consultation; and proposed calling in,
      without delay, Dr. Freiber, the medical assistant of Mr.
      Millingen, and Luca Vaya, a Greek, the physician of Mavrocordato.
      On hea[r]ing <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg209" id=
      "pg209">209</a></span> this, Lord Byron at first refused to see
      them; but being informed that Mavrocordato advised it, he
      said,&mdash;"Very well, let them come; but let them look at me
      and say nothing." This they promised, and were admitted; but when
      one of them, on feeling his pulse, showed a wish to
      speak&mdash;"Recollect," he said, "your promise, and go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after this consultation of the physicians<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, that, as it appeared to Count Gamba, Lord
      Byron was, for the first time, aware of his approaching end. Mr.
      Millingen, Fletcher, and Tita had been standing round his bed;
      but the two first, unable to restrain their tears, left the room.
      Tita also wept; but, as Byron held his hand, could not retire.
      He, however, turned away his face; while Byron, looking at him
      steadily, said, half smiling, "Oh questa è una bella scena!" He
      then seemed to reflect a moment, and exclaimed, "Call Parry."
      Almost immediately afterwards, a fit of delirium ensued; and he
      began to talk wildly, as if he were mounting a breach in an
      assault,&mdash;calling out, half in English, half in Italian,
      "Forwards&mdash;forwards&mdash;courage&mdash;follow my example,"
      &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: For Mr. Millingen's account of this consultation,
        see Appendix.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      On coming again to himself, he asked Fletcher, who had then
      returned into the room, "whether he had sent for Dr. Thomas, as
      he desired?" and the servant answering in the affirmative, he
      replied, "You have done right, for I should like to know what is
      the matter with me." He had, a short time before, with
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg210" id="pg210">210</a></span>
      that kind consideration for those about him which was one of the
      great sources of their lasting attachment to him, said to
      Fletcher, "I am afraid you and Tita will be ill with sitting up
      night and day." It was now evident that he knew he was dying; and
      between his anxiety to make his servant understand his last
      wishes, and the rapid failure of his powers of utterance, a most
      painful scene ensued. On Fletcher asking whether he should bring
      pen and paper to take down his words&mdash;"Oh no," he
      replied&mdash;"there is no time&mdash;it is now nearly over. Go
      to my sister&mdash;tell her&mdash;go to Lady Byron&mdash;you will
      see her, and say &mdash;&mdash;" Here his voice faltered, and
      became gradually indistinct; notwithstanding which he continued
      still to mutter to himself, for nearly twenty minutes, with much
      earnestness of manner, but in such a tone that only a few words
      could be distinguished. These, too, were only
      names,&mdash;"Augusta,"&mdash;"Ada,"&mdash;"Hobhouse,"&mdash;"Kinnaird."
      He then said, "Now, I have told you all." "My Lord," replied
      Fletcher, "I have not understood a word your Lordship has been
      saying."&mdash;"Not understand me?" exclaimed Lord Byron, with a
      look of the utmost distress, "what a pity!&mdash;then it is too
      late; all is over."&mdash;"I hope not," answered Fletcher; "but
      the Lord's will be done!"&mdash;"Yes, not mine," said Byron. He
      then tried to utter a few words, of which none were intelligible,
      except "my sister&mdash;my child."
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision adopted at the consultation had been, contrary to
      the opinion of Mr. Millingen and Dr. Freiber, to administer to
      the patient a strong antispasmodic <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg211" id="pg211">211</a></span> potion, which, while it
      produced sleep, but hastened perhaps death. In order to persuade
      him into taking this draught, Mr. Parry was sent for<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, and, without any difficulty, induced him to
      swallow a few mouthfuls. "When he took my hand," says Parry, "I
      found his hands were deadly cold. With the assistance of Tita I
      endeavoured gently to create a little warmth in them; and also
      loosened the bandage which was tied round his head. Till this was
      done he seemed in great pain, clenched his hands at times,
      gnashed his teeth, and uttered the Italian exclamation of 'Ah
      Christi!' He bore the loosening of the band passively, and, after
      it was loosened, shed tears; then taking my hand again, uttered a
      faint good night, and sunk into a slumber."

        [Footnote 1: From this circumstance, as well as from the terms
        in which he is mentioned by Lord Byron, it is plain that this

      In about half an hour he again awoke, when a second dose of the
      strong infusion was administered to him. "From those about him,"
      says Count Gamba, who was not able to bear this scene himself, "I
      collected that, either at this time, or in his former interval of
      reason, he could be understood to say&mdash;'Poor
      Greece!&mdash;poor town!&mdash;my poor servants!' Also, 'Why was
      I not aware of this sooner?' and 'My hour is come!&mdash;I do not
      care for death&mdash;but why did I not go home before I came
      here?' At another time he said, 'There are <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg212" id="pg212">212</a></span> things which
      make the world dear to me <i>Io lascio qualche cosa di caro nel
      mondo</i>: for the rest, I am content to die.' He spoke also of
      Greece, saying, 'I have given her my time, my means, my
      health&mdash;and now I give her my life!&mdash;what could I do
      more?'"<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

        [Footnote 1: It is but right to remind the reader, that for the
        sayings here attributed to Lord Byron, however natural and
        probable they may appear, there is not exactly the same

        I have given of his last hours are supported.]

      It was about six o'clock on the evening of this day when he said,
      "Now I shall go to sleep;" and then turning round fell into that
      slumber from which he never awoke. For the next twenty-four hours
      he lay incapable of either sense or motion,&mdash;with the
      exception of, now and then, slight symptoms of suffocation,
      during which his servant raised his head,&mdash;and at a quarter
      past six o'clock on the following day, the 19th, he was seen to
      open his eyes and immediately shut them again. The physicians
      felt his pulse&mdash;he was no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      To attempt to describe how the intelligence of this sad event
      struck upon all hearts would be as difficult as it is
      superfluous. He, whom the whole world was to mourn, had on the
      tears of Greece peculiar claim,&mdash;for it was at her feet he
      now laid down the harvest of such a life of fame. To the people
      of Missolonghi, who first felt the shock that was soon to spread
      through all Europe, the event seemed almost incredible. It was
      but the other day that he had come among them, radiant with
      renown,&mdash;inspiring <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg213" id=
      "pg213">213</a></span> faith, by his very name, in those miracles
      of success that were about to spring forth at the touch of his
      ever-powerful genius. All this had now vanished like a short
      dream:&mdash;nor can we wonder that the poor Greeks, to whom his
      coming had been such a glory, and who, on the last evening of his
      life, thronged the streets, enquiring as to his state, should
      regard the thunder-storm which, at the moment he died, broke over
      the town, as a signal of his doom, and, in their superstitious
      grief, cry to each other, "The great man is gone!"<span class=

      "The present day of festivity and rejoicing has become one of
      sorrow and of mourning. The Lord Noel Byron departed this life at
      six o'clock in the afternoon, after an illness of ten days; his
      death being caused by an inflammatory fever. Such was the effect
      of his Lordship's illness on the public mind, that all classes
      had forgotten their usual recreations of Easter, even before the
      afflicting event was apprehended. <span class="pagenum"><a name=

      many other places through Greece. At Salona, where the Congress
      had assembled, his soul was prayed for in the Church; after which
      the whole garrison and the citizens went out into the plain,
      where another religious ceremony took place, under the shade of
      the olive trees. This being concluded, the troops fired; and an
      oration, full of the warmest praise and gratitude, was pronounced
      by the High Priest.

    <p>
      When such was the veneration shown towards him by strangers, what
      must have been the feelings of his near associates and
      attendants? Let one speak for all:&mdash;"He died (says Count
      Gamba) in a strange land, and amongst strangers; but more loved,
      more sincerely wept he never could have been, wherever he had
      breathed his last. Such was the attachment, mingled with a sort
      of reverence and enthusiasm, with which he inspired those around
      him, that there was not one of us who would not, for his sake,
      have willingly encountered any danger in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Stanhope, whom the sad intelligence reached at Salona,
      thus writes to the Committee:&mdash;"A courier has just arrived
      from the Chief Scalza. Alas! all our fears are realised. The soul
      of Byron has taken its last flight. England has lost her
      brightest genius, Greece her noblest friend. To console them for
      the loss, he has left behind the emanations of his splendid mind.
      If Byron had faults, he had redeeming virtues too&mdash;he
      sacrificed his comfort, fortune, health, and life, to the cause
      of an oppressed nation. Honoured be his memory!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trelawney, who was on his way to Missolonghi <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg216" id="pg216">216</a></span> at the time,
      describes as follows the manner in which he first heard of his
      friend's death:&mdash;"With all my anxiety I could not get here
      before the third day. It was the second, after having crossed the
      first great torrent, that I met some soldiers from Missolonghi. I
      had let them all pass me, ere I had resolution enough to enquire
      the news from Missolonghi. I then rode back, and demanded of a
      straggler the news. I heard nothing more than&mdash;Lord Byron is
      dead,&mdash;and I proceeded on in gloomy silence." The writer
      adds, after detailing the particulars of the poet's illness and
      death, "Your pardon, Stanhope, that I have thus turned aside from
      the great cause in which I am embarked. But this is no private
      grief. The world has lost its greatest man; I my best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among his servants the same feeling of sincere grief
      prevailed:&mdash;"I have in my possession (says Mr. Hoppner, in
      the Notices with which he has favoured me,) a letter written by
      his gondolier Tita, who had accompanied him from Venice, giving
      an account to his parents of his master's decease. Of this event
      the poor fellow speaks in the most affecting manner, telling them
      that in Lord Byron he had lost a father rather than a master; and
      expatiating upon the indulgence with which he had always treated
      his domestics, and the care he expressed for their comfort and
      welfare."
    </p>
    <p>
      His valet Fletcher, too, in a letter to Mr. Murray, announcing
      the event, says, "Please to excuse all defects, for I scarcely
      know what I either say or do; for, after twenty years' service
      with my Lord, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg217" id=
      "pg217">217</a></span> was more to me than a father, and I am too
      much distressed to give now a correct account of every
      particular."
    </p>
    <p>
      In speaking of the effect produced on the friends of Greece by
      this event, Mr. Trelawney says,&mdash;"I think Byron's name was
      the great means of getting the Loan. A Mr. Marshall, with
      8000<i>l</i>. per annum, was as far as Corfu, and turned back on
      hearing of Lord Byron's death. Thousands of people were flocking
      here: some had arrived as far as Corfu, and hearing of his death,
      confessed they came out to devote their fortunes not to the
      Greeks, or from interest in the cause, but to the noble poet; and
      the 'Pilgrim of Eternity<span class="fnref">[1]</span>' having

        [Footnote 2: Parry, too, mentions an instance to the same
        effect:&mdash;"While I was on the quarantine-house at Zante, a
        gentleman called on me, and made numerous enquiries as to Lord
        Byron. He said he was only one of fourteen English gentlemen,
        then at Ancona, who had sent him on to obtain intelligence, and
        only waited his return to come and join Lord Byron. They were
        to form a mounted guard for him, and meant to devote their
        personal services and their incomes to the Greek cause. On
        hearing of Lord Byron's death, however, they turned back."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The funeral ceremony, which, on account of the rains, had been
      postponed for a day, took place in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg218" id="pg218">218</a></span> the church of St. Nicholas, at
      Missolonghi, on the 22d of April, and is thus feelingly described
      by an eye-witness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the midst of his own brigade, of the troops of the
      Government, and of the whole population, on the shoulders of the
      officers of his corps, relieved occasionally by other Greeks, the
      most precious portion of his honoured remains were carried to the
      church, where lie the bodies of Marco Bozzari and of General
      Normann. There we laid them down: the coffin was a rude,
      ill-constructed chest of wood; a black mantle served for a pall;
      and over it we placed a helmet and a sword, and a crown of
      laurel. But no funeral pomp could have left the impression, nor
      spoken the feelings, of this simple ceremony. The wretchedness
      and desolation of the place itself; the wild and half-civilised
      warriors around us; their deep-felt, unaffected grief; the fond
      recollections; the disappointed hopes; the anxieties and sad
      presentiments which might be read on every countenance;&mdash;all
      contributed to form a scene more moving, more truly affecting,
      than perhaps was ever before witnessed round the grave of a great
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the funeral service was over, we left the bier in the
      middle of the church, where it remained until the evening of the
      next day, and was guarded by a detachment of his own brigade. The
      church was crowded without cessation by those who came to honour
      and to regret the benefactor of Greece. In the evening of the
      23d, the bier was privately carried back by his officers to his
      own house. The coffin was not closed till the 29th of the month.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg219" id="pg219">219</a></span>
      Immediately after his death, his countenance had an air of
      calmness, mingled with a severity, that seemed gradually to
      soften; for when I took a last look of him, the expression, at
      least to my eyes, was truly sublime."
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen how decidedly, while in Italy, Lord Byron expressed
      his repugnance to the idea of his remains resting upon English
      ground; and the injunctions he so frequently gave to Mr. Hoppner
      on this point show his wishes to have been,&mdash;at least,
      during that period,&mdash;sincere. With one so changing, however,
      in his impulses, it was not too much to take for granted that the
      far more cordial feeling entertained by him towards his
      countrymen at Cephalonia would have been followed by a
      correspondent change in this antipathy to England as a last
      resting-place. It is, at all events, fortunate that by no such
      spleen of the moment has his native country been deprived of her
      natural right to enshrine within her own bosom one of the noblest
      of her dead, and to atone for any wrong she may have inflicted
      upon him, while living, by making his tomb a place of pilgrimage
      for her sons through all ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Colonel Stanhope and others it was suggested that, as a
      tribute to the land he celebrated and died for, his remains
      should be deposited at Athens, in the Temple of Theseus; and the
      Chief Odysseus despatched an express to Missolonghi to enforce
      this wish. On the part of the town, too, in which he breathed his
      last, a similar request had been made by the citizens; and it was
      thought advisable so far to accede to their desires as to leave
      with them, for <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg220" id=
      "pg220">220</a></span> interment, one of the vessels, in which
      his remains, after embalmment, were enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step taken, before any decision as to its ultimate
      disposal, was to have the body conveyed to Zante; and every
      facility having been afforded by the Resident, Sir Frederick
      Stoven, in providing and sending transports to Missolonghi for
      that purpose, on the morning of the 2d of May the remains were
      embarked, under a mournful salute from the guns of the
      fortress:&mdash;"How different," says Count Gamba, "from that
      which had welcomed the arrival of Byron only four months ago!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At Zante, the determination was taken to send the body to
      England; and the brig Florida, which had just arrived there with
      the first instalment of the Loan, was engaged for the purpose.
      Mr. Blaquiere, under whose care this first portion of the Loan
      had come, was also the bearer of a Commission for the due
      management of its disposal in Greece, in which Lord Byron was
      named as the principal Commissioner. The same ship, however, that
      brought this honourable mark of confidence was to return with him
      a corpse. To Colonel Stanhope, who was then at Zante, on his way
      homeward, was intrusted the charge of his illustrious colleague's
      remains; and on the 25th of May he embarked with them on board
      the Florida for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the letter which, on his arrival in the Downs, June 29th, this
      gentleman addressed to Lord Byron's executors, there is the
      following passage:&mdash;"With respect to the funeral ceremony, I
      am of opinion that his Lordship's family should be immediately
      consulted, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg221" id=
      "pg221">221</a></span> and that sanction should be obtained for
      the public burial of his body either in the great Abbey or
      Cathedral of London." It has been asserted, and I fear too truly,
      that on some intimation of the wish suggested in this last
      sentence being conveyed to one of those Reverend persons who have
      the honours of the Abbey at their disposal, such an answer was
      returned as left but little doubt that a refusal would be the
      result of any more regular application.<span class=

      There is an anecdote told of the poet Hafiz, in Sir William
      Jones's Life, which, in reporting this instance of illiberality,
      recurs naturally to the memory. After the death of the great
      Persian bard, some of the religious among his countrymen
      protested strongly against allowing to him the right of
      sepulture, alleging, as their objection, the licentiousness of
      his poetry. After much controversy, it was agreed to leave the
      decision of the question to a mode of divination, not uncommon
      among the Persians, which consisted in opening the poet's book at
      random and taking the first verses that occurred. They happened
      to be these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Oh turn not coldly from the poet's bier,
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor check the sacred drops by Pity given;
      </p>
      <p>
        For though in sin his body slumbereth here,
      </p>
      <p>
        His soul, absolved, already wings to heaven."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg222" id=
      "pg222">222</a></span>These lines, says the legend, were looked
      upon as a divine decree; the religionists no longer enforced
      their objections, and the remains of the bard were left to take
      their quiet sleep by that "sweet bower of Mosellay" which he had
      so often celebrated in his verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were our Byron's right of sepulture to be decided in the same
      manner, how few are there of his pages, thus taken at hazard,
      that would not, by some genial touch of sympathy with virtue,
      some glowing tribute to the bright works of God, or some gush of
      natural devotion more affecting than any homily, give him a title
      to admission into the purest temple of which Christian Charity
      ever held the guardianship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the decision, however, of these Reverend authorities have
      been, finally, what it might, it was the wish, as is understood,
      of Lord Byron's dearest relative to have his remains laid in the
      family vault at Hucknall, near Newstead. On being landed from the
      Florida, the body had, under the direction of his Lordship's
      executors, Mr. Hobhouse and Mr. Hanson, been removed to the house
      of Sir Edward Knatchbull in Great George Street, Westminster,
      where it lay in state during Friday and Saturday, the 9th and
      10th of July, and on the following Monday the funeral procession
      took place. Leaving Westminster at eleven o'clock in the morning,
      attended by most of his Lordship's personal friends and by the
      carriages of several persons of rank, it proceeded through
      various streets of the metropolis towards the North Road. At
      Pancras Church, the ceremonial of the procession being at an end,
      the carriages returned; <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg223" id=

      stages, to Nottingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on Friday the 16th of July that, in the small village
      church of Hucknall, the last duties were paid to the remains of
      Byron, by depositing them, close to those of his mother, in the
      family vault. Exactly on the same day of the same month in the
      preceding year, he had said, it will be recollected,
      despondingly, to Count Gamba, "Where shall we be in another

      paid a visit, some months after the interment, to Hucknall, and
      was much struck, as I have heard, on approaching the village, by
      the strong likeness it seemed to him to bear to his lost friend's
      melancholy deathplace, Missolonghi.

      all his real estates at Rochdale and elsewhere, together with
      such part of his other property as was not settled upon Lady
      Byron and his daughter Ada, to be by Mrs. Leigh enjoyed, free
      from her husband's control, during her life, and, after her
      decease, to be inherited by her children.

    <p>
      We have now followed to its close a life which, brief as was its
      span, may be said, perhaps, to have comprised within itself a
      greater variety of those excitements and interest which spring
      out of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg227" id=
      "pg227">227</a></span> deep workings of passion and of intellect
      than any that the pen of biography has ever before commemorated.
      As there still remain among the papers of my friend some curious
      gleanings which, though in the abundance of our materials I have
      not hitherto found a place for them, are too valuable towards the
      illustration of his character to be lost, I shall here, in
      selecting them for the reader, avail myself of the opportunity of
      trespassing, for the last time, on his patience with a few
      general remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been observed, throughout these pages, and by some,
      perhaps, with disappointment, that into the character of Lord
      Byron, as a poet, there has been little, if any, critical
      examination; but that, content with expressing generally the
      delight which, in common with all, I derive from his poetry, I
      have left the task of analysing the sources from which this
      delight springs to others.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> In thus
      evading, if it <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg228" id=
      "pg228">228</a></span> must be so considered, one of my duties as
      a biographer, I have been influenced no less by a sense of my own
      inaptitude for the office of critic than by recollecting with
      what assiduity, throughout the whole of the poet's career, every
      new rising of his genius was watched from the great observatories
      of Criticism, and the ever changing varieties of its course and
      splendour tracked out and recorded with a degree of skill and
      minuteness which has left but little for succeeding observers to
      discover. It is, moreover, into the character and conduct of Lord
      Byron, as a man, not distinct from, but forming, on the contrary,
      the best illustration of his character, as a writer, that it has
      been the more immediate purpose of these volumes to enquire; and
      if, in the course of them, any satisfactory clue has been
      afforded to those anomalies, moral and intellectual, which his
      life exhibited,&mdash;still more, should it have been the effect
      of my humble labours to clear away some of those mists that hung
      round my friend, and show him, in most respects, as worthy of
      love as he was, in all, of admiration, then will the chief and
      sole aim of this work have been accomplished.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: It may be making too light of criticism to say
        with Gray that "even a bad verse is as good a thing or better
        than the best observation that ever was made upon it;" but
        there are surely few tasks that appear more thankless and
        superfluous than that of following, as Criticism sometimes
        does, in the rear of victorious genius (like the commentators
        on a field of Blenheim or of Waterloo), and either labouring to
        point out to us <i>why</i> it has triumphed, or still more
        unprofitably contending that it <i>ought</i> to have failed.
        The well-known passage of La Bruyère, which even Voltaire's
        adulatory application of it to some work of the King of Prussia
        has not spoiled for use, puts, perhaps, in its true point of
        view the very subordinate rank which Criticism must be content
        to occupy in the train of successful Genius:&mdash;"Quand une
        lecture vous élève l'esprit et qu'elle vous inspire des
        sentimens nobles, ne cherehez pas une autre règle pour juger de
        l'ouvrage; il est bon et fait de main de l'ouvrier: La
        Critique, après ça, peut s'exercer sur les petites choses,
        relever quelques expressions, corriger des phrases, parler de
        syntaxe," &amp;c. &amp;c.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Having devoted to this object so large a portion of my own share
      of these pages, and, yet more fairly, enabled the world to form a
      judgment for itself, by placing the man, in his own person, and
      without <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg229" id=
      "pg229">229</a></span> disguise, before all eyes, there would
      seem to remain now but an easy duty in summing up the various
      points of his character, and, out of the features, already
      separately described, combining one complete portrait. The task,
      however, is by no means so easy as it may appear. There are few
      characters in which a near acquaintance does not enable us to
      discover some one leading principle or passion consistent enough
      in its operations to be taken confidently into account in any
      estimate of the disposition in which they are found. Like those
      points in the human face, or figure, to which all its other
      proportions are referable, there is in most minds some one
      governing influence, from which chiefly,&mdash;though, of course,
      biassed on some occasions by others,&mdash;all its various
      impulses and tendencies will be found to radiate. In Lord Byron,
      however, this sort of pivot of character was almost wholly
      wanting. Governed as he was at different moments by totally
      different passions, and impelled sometimes, as during his short
      access of parsimony in Italy, by springs of action never before
      developed in his nature, in him this simple mode of tracing
      character to its sources must be often wholly at fault; and if,
      as is not impossible, in trying to solve the strange variances of
      his mind, I should myself be found to have fallen into
      contradictions and inconsistencies, the extreme difficulty of
      analysing, without dazzle or bewilderment, such an unexampled
      complication of qualities must be admitted as my excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      So various, indeed, and contradictory, were his attributes, both
      moral and intellectual, that he may <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg230" id="pg230">230</a></span> be pronounced
      to have been not one, but many: nor would it be any great
      exaggeration of the truth to say, that out of the mere partition
      of the properties of his single mind a plurality of characters,
      all different and all vigorous, might have been furnished. It was
      this multiform aspect exhibited by him that led the world, during
      his short wondrous career, to compare him with that medley host
      of personages, almost all differing from each other, which he
      thus playfully enumerates in one of his Journals:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been thinking over, the other day, on the various
      comparisons, good or evil, which I have seen published of myself
      in different journals, English and foreign. This was suggested to
      me by accidentally turning over a foreign one lately,&mdash;for I
      have made it a rule latterly never to <i>search</i> for any thing
      of the kind, but not to avoid the perusal, if presented by
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin, then: I have seen myself compared, personally or
      poetically, in English, French, <i>German</i> (<i>as</i>
      interpreted to me), Italian, and Portuguese, within these nine
      years, to Rousseau, Goethe, Young, Aretine, Timon of Athens,
      Dante, Petrarch, 'an alabaster vase, lighted up within,' Satan,
      Shakspeare, Buonaparte, Tiberius, Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides,
      Harlequin, the Clown, Sternhold and Hopkins, to the
      phantasmagoria, to Henry the Eighth, to Chenier, to Mirabeau, to
      young R. Dallas (the schoolboy), to Michael Angelo, to Raphael,
      to a petit-maître, to Diogenes, to Childe Harold, to Lara, to the
      Count in Beppo, to Milton, to Pope, to Dryden, to Burns, to
      Savage, to Chatterton, to 'oft have I <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg231" id="pg231">231</a></span> heard of
      thee, my Lord Biron,' in Shakspeare, to Churchill the poet, to
      Kean the actor, to Alfieri, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The likeness to Alfieri was asserted very seriously by an
      Italian who had known him in his younger days. It of course
      related merely to our apparent personal dispositions. He did not
      assert it to <i>me</i> (for we were not then good friends), but
      in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The object of so many contradictory comparisons must probably be
      like something different from them all; but what <i>that</i> is,
      is more than <i>I</i> know, or any body else."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be uninteresting, were there either space or time
      for such a task, to take a review of the names of note in the
      preceding list, and show in how many points, though differing so
      materially among themselves, it might be found that each
      presented a striking resemblance to Lord Byron. We have seen, for
      instance, that wrongs and sufferings were, through life, the main
      sources of Byron's inspiration. Where the hoof of the critic
      struck, the fountain was first disclosed; and all the tramplings
      of the world afterwards but forced out the stream stronger and
      brighter. The same obligations to misfortune, the same debt to
      the "oppressor's wrong," for having wrung out from bitter
      thoughts the pure essence of his genius, was due no less deeply
      by Dante!&mdash;"quum illam sub amarâ cogitatione excitatam,
      occulti divinique ingenii vim exacuerit et
      inflammarit."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Paulus Jovius.&mdash;Bayle, too, says of him, "Il
        fit entrer plus de feu et plus de force dans ses livres qu'il
        n'y en eût mis s'il avoit joui d'une condition plus
        tranquille."]

      In that contempt for the world's opinion, which led Dante to
      exclaim, "Lascia dir le genti," Lord Byron also bore a strong
      resemblance to that poet,&mdash;though far more, it must be
      confessed, in profession than reality. For, while scorn for the
      public voice was on his lips, the keenest sensitiveness to its
      every breath was in his heart; and, as if every feeling of his
      nature was to have some painful mixture in it, together with the
      pride of Dante which led him to disdain public opinion, he
      combined the susceptibility of Petrarch which placed him
      shrinkingly at its mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His agreement, in some other features of character, with
      Petrarch, I have already had occasion to remark<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>; and if it be true, as is often surmised, that
      Byron's want of a due reverence for Shakspeare arose from some
      latent and hardly conscious jealousy <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg233" id="pg233">233</a></span> of that
      poet's fame, a similar feeling is known to have existed in
      Petrarch towards Dante; and the same reason assigned for
      it,&mdash;that from the living he had nothing to fear, while
      before the shade of Dante he might have reason to feel
      humbled,&mdash;is also not a little applicable<span class=
      "fnref">[2]</span> in the case of Lord Byron.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Some passages in Foscolo's Essay on Petrarch may
        be applied, with equal truth, to Lord Byron.&mdash;For
        instance, "It was hardly possible with Petrarch to write a
        sentence without portraying himself"&mdash;"Petrarch, allured
        by the idea that his celebrity would magnify into importance
        all the ordinary occurrences of his life, satisfied the
        curiosity of the world," &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and again, with
        still more striking applicability,&mdash;"In Petrarch's
        letters, as well as in his Poems and Treatises, we always
        identify the author with the man, who felt himself irresistibly
        impelled to develope his own intense feelings. Being endowed
        with almost all the noble, and with some of the paltry passions
        of our nature, and having never attempted to conceal them, he
        awakens us to reflection upon ourselves while we contemplate in
        him a being of our own species, yet different from any other,
        and whose originality excites even more sympathy than
        admiration."]

      Between the dispositions and habits of Alfieri and those of the

      traced; and the sonnet in which the Italian dramatist professes

      By the extract just given from his Journal, it will be perceived
      that, in Byron's own opinion, a character which, like his,
      admitted of so many contradictory comparisons, could not be
      otherwise than wholly undefinable itself. It will be found,
      however, on reflection, that this very versatility, which renders
      it so difficult to fix, "ere it change," the fairy fabric of his
      character, is, in itself, the true clue through all that fabric's
      mazes,&mdash;is in itself the solution of whatever was most
      dazzling in his might or startling in his levity, of all that
      most <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg234" id=
      "pg234">234</a></span> attracted and repelled, whether in his
      life or his genius. A variety of powers almost boundless, and a
      pride no less vast in displaying them,&mdash;a susceptibility of
      new impressions and impulses, even beyond the usual allotment of
      genius, and an uncontrolled impetuosity, as well from habit as
      temperament, in yielding to them,&mdash;such were the two great
      and leading sources of all that varied spectacle which his life
      exhibited; of that succession of victories achieved by his
      genius, in almost every field of mind that genius ever trod, and
      of all those sallies of character in every shape and direction
      that unchecked feeling and dominant self-will could dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be perceived by all endowed with quick powers of
      association how constantly, when any particular thought or
      sentiment presents itself to their minds, its very opposite, at
      the same moment, springs up there also:&mdash;if any thing
      sublime occurs, its neighbour, the ridiculous, is by its
      side;&mdash;across a bright view of the present or the future, a
      dark one throws its shadow;&mdash;and, even in questions
      respecting morals and conduct, all the reasonings and
      consequences that may suggest themselves on the side of one of
      two opposite courses will, in such minds, be instantly confronted
      by an array just as cogent on the other. A mind of this
      structure,&mdash;and such, more or less, are all those in which
      the reasoning is made subservient to the imaginative
      faculty,&mdash;though enabled, by such rapid powers of
      association, to multiply its resources without end, has need of
      the constant exercise of a controlling judgment to keep its
      perceptions pure and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg235" id=
      "pg235">235</a></span> undisturbed between the contrasts it thus
      simultaneously calls up; the obvious danger being that, where
      matters of taste are concerned, the habit of forming such
      incongruous juxtapositions&mdash;as that, for example, between
      the burlesque and sublime&mdash;should at last vitiate the mind's
      relish for the nobler and higher quality; and that, on the yet
      more important subject of morals, a facility in finding reasons
      for every side of a question may end, if not in the choice of the
      worst, at least in a sceptical indifference to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In picturing to oneself so awful an event as a shipwreck, its
      many horrors and perils are what alone offer themselves to
      ordinary fancies. But the keen, versatile imagination of Byron
      could detect in it far other details, and, at the same moment
      with all that is fearful and appalling in such a scene, could
      bring together all that is most ludicrous and low. That in this
      painful mixture he was but too true to human nature, the
      testimony of De Retz (himself an eye-witness of such an event)
      attests:&mdash;"Vous ne pouvez vous imaginer (says the Cardinal)
      l'horreur d'une grande tempête;&mdash;vous en pouvez imaginer
      aussi pen le ridicule." But, assuredly, a poet less wantoning in
      the variety of his power, and less proud of displaying it, would
      have paused ere he mixed up, thus mockingly, the degradation of
      humanity with its sufferings, and, content to probe us to the
      core with the miseries of our fellow-men, would have forborne to
      wring from us, the next moment, a bitter smile at their baseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the moral sense so dangerous are the effects <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg236" id="pg236">236</a></span> of this
      quality, that it would hardly, perhaps, be generalising too
      widely to assert that wheresoever great versatility of power
      exists, there will also be found a tendency to versatility of
      principle. The poet Chatterton, in whose soul the seeds of all
      that is good and bad in genius so prematurely ripened, said, in
      the consciousness of this multiple faculty, that he "held that
      man in contempt who could not write on both sides of a question;"
      and it was by acting in accordance with this principle himself
      that he brought one of the few stains upon his name which a life
      so short afforded time to incur. Mirabeau, too, when, in the
      legal warfare between his father and mother, he helped to draw up
      for each the pleadings against the other, was influenced less, no
      doubt, by the pleasure of mischief than by this pride of talent,
      and lost sight of the unnatural perfidy of the task in the
      adroitness with which he executed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality which I have here denominated versatility, as applied
      to <i>power</i>, Lord Byron has himself designated by the French
      word "mobility," as applied to <i>feeling</i> and <i>conduct</i>;
      and, in one of the Cantos of Don Juan, has described happily some
      of its lighter features. After telling us that his hero had begun
      to doubt, from the great predominance of this quality in her,
      "how much of Adeline was <i>real</i>," he says,&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "So well she acted, all and every part,
      </p>
      <p class="i2">
        By turns,&mdash;with that vivacious versatility,
      </p>
      <p>
        Which many people take for want of heart.
      </p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg237" id=

      <p class="i2">
        They err&mdash;'tis merely what is called mobility,
      </p>
      <p>
        A thing of temperament and not of art,
      </p>
      <p class="i2">
        Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;
      </p>
      <p>
        And false&mdash;though true; for surely they're sincerest,

    <p>
      That he was fully aware not only of the abundance of this quality
      in his own nature, but of the danger in which it placed
      consistency and singleness of character, did not require the note
      on this passage, where he calls it "an unhappy attribute," to
      assure us. The consciousness, indeed, of his own natural tendency
      to yield thus to every chance impression, and change with every
      passing impulse, was not only for ever present in his mind,
      but,&mdash;aware as he was of the suspicion of weakness attached
      by the world to any retractation or abandonment of long professed
      opinions,&mdash;had the effect of keeping him in that general
      line of consistency, on certain great subjects, which,
      notwithstanding occasional fluctuations and contradictions as to
      the details of these very subjects, he continued to preserve
      throughout life. A passage from one of his manuscripts will show
      how sagaciously he saw the necessity of guarding himself against
      his own instability in this respect. "The world visits change of
      politics or change of religion with a more severe censure than a
      mere difference of opinion would appear to me to deserve. But
      there must be some reason for this feeling;&mdash;and I think it
      is that these departures from the earliest instilled ideas of our
      childhood, and from the line of conduct chosen by us when we
      first enter into public life, have been seen to have more
      mischievous results <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg238" id=
      "pg238">238</a></span> for society, and to prove more weakness of
      mind than other actions, in themselves, more immoral."
    </p>
    <p>
      The same distrust in his own steadiness, thus keeping alive in
      him a conscientious self-watchfulness, concurred not a little, I
      have no doubt, with the innate kindness of his nature, to
      preserve so constant and unbroken the greater number of his
      attachments through life;&mdash;some of them, as in the instance
      of his mother, owing evidently more to a sense of duty than to
      real affection, the consistency with which, so creditably to the
      strength of his character, they were maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while in these respects, as well as in the sort of task-like
      perseverance with which the habits and amusements of his youth
      were held fast by him, he succeeded in conquering the
      variableness and love of novelty so natural to him, in all else
      that could engage his mind, in all the excursions, whether of his
      reason or his fancy, he gave way to this versatile humour without
      scruple or check,&mdash;taking every shape in which genius could
      manifest its power, and transferring himself to every region of
      thought where new conquests were to be achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible but that such a range of will and power should
      be abused. It was impossible that, among the spirits he invoked
      from all quarters, those of darkness should not appear, at his
      bidding, with those of light. And here the dangers of an energy
      so multifold, and thus luxuriating in its own transformations,
      show themselves. To this one great object of displaying
      power,&mdash;various, splendid, and all-adorning
      power,&mdash;every other consideration and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg239" id="pg239">239</a></span> duty were but
      too likely to be sacrificed. Let the advocate but display his
      eloquence and art, no matter what the cause;&mdash;let the stamp
      of energy be but left behind, no matter with what seal.
      <i>Could</i> it have been expected that from such a career no
      mischief would ensue, or that among these cross-lights of
      imagination the moral vision could remain undisturbed? <i>Is</i>
      it to be at all wondered at that in the works of one thus gifted
      and carried away, we should find,&mdash;wholly, too, without any
      prepense design of corrupting on his side,&mdash;a false
      splendour given to Vice to make it look like Virtue, and Evil too
      often invested with a grandeur which belongs intrinsically but to
      Good?
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the less serious ills flowing from this abuse of his great
      versatile powers,&mdash;more especially as exhibited in his most
      characteristic work, Don Juan,&mdash;it will be found that even
      the strength and impressiveness of his poetry is sometimes not a
      little injured by the capricious and desultory flights into which
      this pliancy of wing allures him. It must be felt, indeed, by all
      readers of that work, and particularly by those who, being gifted
      with but a small portion of such ductility themselves, are unable
      to keep pace with his changes, that the suddenness with which he
      passes from one strain of sentiment to another,&mdash;from the
      frolic to the sad, from the cynical to the tender,&mdash;begets a
      distrust in the sincerity of one or both moods of mind which
      interferes with, if not chills, the sympathy that a more natural
      transition would inspire. In general such a suspicion would do
      him injustice; as, among the singular combinations <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg240" id="pg240">240</a></span> which his
      mind presented, that of uniting at once versatility and depth of
      feeling was not the least remarkable. But, on the whole,
      favourable as was all this quickness and variety of association
      to the extension of the range and resources of his poetry, it may
      be questioned whether a more select concentration of his powers
      would not have afforded a still more grand and precious result.
      Had the minds of Milton and Tasso been thus thrown open to the
      incursions of light, ludicrous fancies, who can doubt that those
      solemn sanctuaries of genius would have been as much injured as
      profaned by the intrusion?&mdash;and it is at least a question
      whether, if Lord Byron had not been so actively versatile, so
      totally under the dominion of
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "A fancy, like the air, most free,

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      he would not have been less wonderful, perhaps, but more great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it only in his poetical creations that this love and
      power of variety showed itself:&mdash;one of the most pervading
      weaknesses of his life may be traced to the same fertile source.
      The pride of personating every description of character, evil as
      well as good, influenced but too much, as we have seen, his
      ambition, and, not a little, his conduct; and as, in poetry, his
      own experience of the ill effects of passion was made to minister
      materials to the workings of his imagination, so, in return, his
      imagination supplied that dark colouring under which he so often
      disguised his true aspect from the world. To such <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg241" id="pg241">241</a></span> a perverse
      length, indeed, did he carry this fancy for self-defamation, that
      if (as sometimes, in his moments of gloom, he persuaded himself,)
      there was any tendency to derangement in his mental
      conformation<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, on this point alone
      could it be pronounced to have manifested itself.<span class=
      "fnref">[2]</span> In the early part of my <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg242" id="pg242">242</a></span> acquaintance
      with him, when he most gave way to this humour,&mdash;for it was
      observable afterwards, when the world joined in his own opinion
      of himself, he rather shrunk from the echo,&mdash;I have known
      him more than once, as we have sat together after dinner, and he
      was, at the time, perhaps, a little under the influence of wine,
      to fall seriously into this sort of dark and self-accusing mood,
      and throw out hints of his past life with an air of gloom and
      mystery designed evidently to awaken curiosity and interest. He
      was, however, too promptly alive to the least approaches of
      ridicule not to perceive, on these occasions, that the gravity of
      his hearer was only prevented from being disturbed by an effort
      of politeness, and he accordingly never again tried this romantic
      mystification upon me. From what I have known, however, of his
      experiments upon more impressible listeners, I have little doubt
      that, to produce effect at the moment, there is hardly any crime
      so dark or desperate of which, in the excitement of thus acting
      upon the imaginations of others, he would not have hinted that he
      had been guilty; and it has sometimes occurred to me that the
      occult cause of his lady's separation from him, round which
      herself and her legal adviser have thrown such formidable
      mystery, may have been nothing more, after all, than some
      imposture of this kind, some dimly hinted confession of undefined
      horrors, which, though intended by the relater but to mystify and
      surprise, the hearer so little understood him as to take in sober
      seriousness.

        [Footnote 1: We have seen how often, in his Journals and
        Letters, this suspicion of his own mental soundness is
        intimated. A similar notion, with respect to himself, seems to
        have taken hold also of the strong mind of Johnson, who, like
        Byron, too, was disposed to attribute to an hereditary tinge
        that melancholy which, as he said, "made him mad all his life,
        at least not sober." This peculiar feature of Johnson's mind
        has, in the late new edition of Boswell's Life of him, given
        rise to some remarks, pregnant with all the editor's well known
        acuteness, which, as bearing on a point so important in the

        Chaworth;&mdash;"a marriage," he says, "for which she
        sacrificed the prospects of two very ancient families, and a
        heart which was hers from ten years old, and a head which has
        never been quite right since."]

        time, to accompany it with an explanatory note. From some
        inadvertence, however, the note was omitted; and, thus left to

      his own name, and even after he had learned from bitter
      experience the rash folly of such a system, there was still, in
      the openness and over-frankness of his nature, and that
      indulgence of impulse with which he gave utterance to, if not
      acted upon, every chance impression of the moment, more than
      sufficient to bring his character, in all its least favourable
      lights, before the world. Who is there, indeed, that could bear
      to be judged by even the best of those unnumbered thoughts that
      course each other, like waves of the sea, through our minds,
      passing away unuttered, and, for the most part, even unowned by
      ourselves?&mdash;Yet to such a test was Byron's character
      throughout his whole life exposed. As well from the precipitance
      with which he gave way to every impulse as from the passion he
      had for recording his own impressions, all those heterogeneous
      thoughts, fantasies, and desires that, in other men's minds,
      "come like shadows, so depart," were <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg244" id="pg244">244</a></span> by him fixed
      and embodied as they presented themselves, and, at once, taking a
      shape cognizable by public opinion, either in his actions or his
      words, either in the hasty letter of the moment, or the poem for
      all time, laid open such a range of vulnerable points before his
      judges, as no one individual perhaps ever before, of himself,
      presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such abundance and variety of materials for portraiture, it
      may easily be conceived how two professed delineators of his
      character, the one over partial and the other malicious,
      might,&mdash;the former, by selecting only the fairer, and the
      latter only the darker, features,&mdash;produce two portraits of
      Lord Byron, as much differing from each other as they would both
      be, on the whole, unlike the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the utter powerlessness of retention with which he promulgated
      his every thought and feeling,&mdash;more especially if at all
      connected with the subject of self,&mdash;without allowing even a
      pause for the almost instinctive consideration whether by such
      disclosures he might not be conveying a calumnious impression of
      himself, a stronger instance could hardly be given than is to be
      found in a conversation held by him with Mr. Trelawney, as
      reported by this latter gentleman, when they were on their way
      together to Greece. After some remarks on the state of his own
      health<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, mental and bodily, he said,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg245" id="pg245">245</a></span>
      "I don't know how it is, but I am so cowardly at times, that if,
      this morning, you had come down and horsewhipped me, I should
      have submitted without opposition. Why is this? If one of these
      fits come over me when we are in Greece, what shall I
      do?"&mdash;"I told him (continues Mr. Trelawney) that it was the
      excessive debility of his nerves. He said, 'Yes, and of my head,
      too. I was very heroic when I left Genoa, but, like Acres, I feel
      my courage oozing out at my palms.'"
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: "He often mentioned," says Mr. Trelawney, "that he
        thought he should not live many years, and said that he would
        die in Greece." This he told me at Cephalonia. He always seemed
        unmoved on these occasions, perfectly indifferent as to when he
        died, only saying that he could not bear pain. On our voyage we
        had been reading with great attention the life and letters of
        Swift, edited by Scott, and we almost daily, or rather nightly,
        talked them over; and he more than once expressed his horror of
        existing in that state, and expressed some fears that it would
        be his fate.]

      It will hardly, by those who know any thing of human nature, be
      denied that such misgivings and heart-sinkings as are here
      described may, under a similar depression of spirits, have found
      their way into the thoughts of some of the gallantest hearts that
      ever breathed;&mdash;but then, untold and unremembered, even by
      the sufferer himself, they passed off with the passing infirmity
      that produced them, leaving neither to truth to record them as
      proofs of want of health, nor to calumny to fasten upon them a
      suspicion of want of bravery. The assertion of some one that all
      men are by nature cowardly would seem to be countenanced by the
      readiness with which most men believe others so. "I have lived,"
      says the Prince de Ligne, "to hear Voltaire called a fool, and
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg246" id=
      "pg246">246</a></span> great Frederick a coward." The Duke of
      Marlborough in his own times, and Napoleon in ours, have found
      persons not only to assert but believe the same charge against
      them. After such glaring instances of the tendency of some minds
      to view greatness only through an inverting medium, it need
      little surprise us that Lord Byron's conduct in Greece should, on
      the same principle, have engendered a similar insinuation against
      him; nor should I have at all noticed the weak slander, but for
      the opportunity which it affords me of endeavouring to point out
      what appears to me the peculiar nature of the courage by which,
      on all occasions that called for it, he so strikingly
      distinguished himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever virtue may be allowed to belong to personal courage, it
      is, most assuredly, they who are endowed by nature with the
      liveliest imaginations, and who have therefore most vividly and
      simultaneously before their eyes all the remote and possible
      consequences of danger, that are most deserving of whatever
      praise attends the exercise of that virtue. A bravery of this
      kind, which springs more out of mind than temperament,&mdash;or
      rather, perhaps, out of the conquest of the former over the
      latter,&mdash;will naturally proportion its exertion to the
      importance of the occasion; and the same person who is seen to
      shrink with an almost feminine fear from ignoble and every-day
      perils, may be found foremost in the very jaws of danger where
      honour is to be either maintained or won. Nor does this remark
      apply only to the imaginative class, of whom I am chiefly
      treating. By the same calculating principle, it will <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg247" id="pg247">247</a></span> be found that
      most men whose bravery is the result not of temperament but
      reflection, are regulated in their daring. The wise De Wit,
      though negligent of his life on great occasions, was not ashamed,
      we are told, of dreading and avoiding whatever endangered it on
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the apprehensiveness that attends quick imaginations, Lord
      Byron had, of course, a considerable share, and in all situations
      of ordinary peril gave way to it without reserve. I have seldom
      seen any person, male or female, more timid in a carriage; and,
      in riding, his preparation against accidents showed the same
      nervous and imaginative fearfulness. "His bridle," says the late
      Lord B&mdash;&mdash;, who rode frequently with him at Genoa,
      "had, besides cavesson and martingale, various reins; and
      whenever he came near a place where his horse was likely to shy,
      he gathered up these said reins and fixed himself as if he was
      going at a five-barred gate." None surely but the most
      superficial or most prejudiced observers could ever seriously
      found upon such indications of nervousness any conclusion against
      the real courage of him who was subject to them. The poet
      Ariosto, who was, it seems, a victim to the same fair-weather
      alarms,&mdash;who, when on horseback, would alight at the least
      appearance of danger, and on the water was particularly
      timorous,&mdash;could yet, in the action between the Pope's
      vessels and the Duke of Ferrara's, fight like a lion; and in the
      same manner the courage of Lord Byron, as all his companions in
      peril testify, was of that noblest kind <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg248" id="pg248">248</a></span> which rises
      with the greatness of the occasion, and becomes but the more
      self-collected and resisting, the more imminent the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      In proposing to show that the distinctive properties of Lord
      Byron's character, as well moral as literary, arose mainly from
      those two great sources, the unexampled versatility of his powers
      and feelings, and the facility with which he gave way to the
      impulses of both, it had been my intention to pursue the subject
      still further in detail, and to endeavour to trace throughout the
      various excellences and defects, both of his poetry and his life,
      the operation of these two dominant attributes of his nature. "No
      men," says Cowper, in speaking of persons of a versatile turn of
      mind, "are better qualified for companions in such a world as
      this than men of such temperament. Every scene of life has two
      sides, a dark and a bright one; and the mind that has an equal
      mixture of melancholy and vivacity is best of all qualified for
      the contemplation of either." It would not be difficult to show
      that to this readiness in reflecting all hues, whether of the
      shadows or the lights of our variegated existence, Lord Byron
      owed not only the great range of his influence as a poet, but
      those powers of fascination which he possessed as a man. This
      susceptibility, indeed, of immediate impressions, which in him
      was so active, lent a charm, of all others the most attractive,
      to his social intercourse, by giving to those who were, at the
      moment, present, such ascendant influence, that they alone for
      the time occupied all his thoughts and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg249" id="pg249">249</a></span> feelings, and
      brought whatever was most agreeable in his nature into
      play.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">

        [Footnote 1: In reference to his power of adapting himself to
        all sorts of society, and taking upon himself all varieties of
        character, I find a passage in one of my early letters to him
        (from Ireland) which, though it might be expressed, perhaps, in
        better taste, is worth citing for its truth:&mdash;"Though I
        have not written, I have seldom ceased to think of you; for you
        are that sort of being whom every thing, high or low, brings
        into one's mind. Whether I am with the wise or the waggish,
        among poets or among pugilists, over the book or over the
        bottle, you are sure to connect yourself transcendently with
        all, and come 'armed for <i>every</i> field' into my memory."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      So much did this extreme mobility,&mdash;this readiness to be
      "strongly acted on by what was nearest,"&mdash;abound in his
      disposition, that, even with the casual acquaintances of the
      hour, his heart was upon his lips<span class="fnref">[1]</span>,
      and it depended wholly upon themselves whether they might not
      become at once the depositories of every secret, if it might be
      so called, of his whole life. That in this convergence of all the
      powers of pleasing towards present objects, those absent should
      be sometimes forgotten, or, what is worse, sacrificed to the
      reigning desire of the moment, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg250" id="pg250">250</a></span> is unluckily one of the alloys
      attendant upon persons of this temperament, which renders their
      fidelity, either as lovers or confidants, not a little
      precarious. But of the charm which such a disposition diffuses
      through the manner there can be but little doubt,&mdash;and least
      of all among those who have ever felt its influence in Lord
      Byron. Neither are the instances in which he has been known to
      make imprudent disclosures of what had been said or written by
      others of the persons with whom he was conversing to be all set
      down to this rash overflow of the social hour. In his own
      frankness of spirit, and hatred of all disguise, this practice,
      pregnant as it was with inconvenience, and sometimes danger, in a
      great degree originated. To confront the accused with the accuser
      was, in such cases, his delight,&mdash;not only as a revenge for
      having been made the medium of what men durst not say openly to
      each other, but as a gratification of that love of small mischief
      which he had retained from boyhood, and which the confusion that
      followed such exposures was always sure to amuse. This habit,
      too, being, as I have before remarked, well known to his friends,
      their sense of prudence, if not their fairness, was put fully on
      its guard, and he himself was spared the pain of hearing what he
      could not, without inflicting still worse, repeat.

        [Footnote 1: It is curious to observe how, in all times, and
        all countries, what is called the poetical temperament has, in
        the great possessors, and victims, of that gift, produced
        similar effects. In the following passage, the biographer of
        Tasso has, in painting that poet, described Byron
        also:&mdash;"There are some persons of a sensibility so
        powerful, that whoever happens to be with them is, at that
        moment, to them the world: their hearts involuntarily open;
        they are prompted by a strong desire to please; and they thus
        make confidants of their sentiments people whom they in reality
        regard with indifference."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      A most apt illustration of this point of his character is to be
      found in an anecdote told of him by Parry, who, though himself
      the victim, had the sense and good temper to perceive the source
      to which Byron's conduct was to be traced. While the Turkish
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg251" id="pg251">251</a></span>
      fleet was blockading Missolonghi, his Lordship, one day, attended
      by Parry, proceeded in a small punt, rowed by a boy, to the mouth
      of the harbour, while in a large boat accompanying them were
      Prince Mavrocordato and his attendants. In this situation, an
      indignant feeling of contempt and impatience at the supineness of
      their Greek friends seized the engineer, and he proceeded to vent
      this feeling to Lord Byron in no very measured terms, pronouncing
      Prince Mavrocordato to be "an old gentlewoman," and concluding,
      according to his own statement, with the following
      words:&mdash;"If I were in their place, I should be in a fever at
      the thought of my own incapacity and ignorance, and should burn
      with impatience to attempt the destruction of those rascal Turks.
      But the Greeks and the Turks are opponents worthy, by their
      imbecility, of each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had scarcely explained myself fully," adds Mr. Parry, "when
      his Lordship ordered our boat to be placed alongside the other,
      and actually related our whole conversation to the Prince. In
      doing it, however, he took on himself the task of pacifying both
      the Prince and me, and though I was at first very angry, and the
      Prince, I believe, very much annoyed, he succeeded. Mavrocordato
      afterwards showed no dissatisfaction with me, and I prized Lord
      Byron's regard too much, to remain long displeased with a
      proceeding which was only an unpleasant manner of reproving us
      both."
    </p>
    <p>
      Into these and other such branches from the main course of his
      character, it might have been a task of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg252" id="pg252">252</a></span> some interest
      to investigate,&mdash;certain as we should be that, even in the
      remotest and narrowest of these windings, some of the brightness
      and strength of the original current would be perceptible. Enough
      however has been, perhaps, said to set other minds upon supplying
      what remains:&mdash;if the track of analysis here opened be the
      true one, to follow it in its further bearings will not be
      difficult. Already, indeed, I may be thought by some readers to
      have occupied too large a portion of these pages, not only in
      tracing out such "nice dependencies" and gradations of my
      friend's character, but still more uselessly, as may be
      conceived, in recording all the various habitudes and whims by
      which the course of his every-day life was distinguished from
      that of other people. That the critics of the day should think it
      due to their own importance to object to trifles is naturally to
      be expected; but that, in other times, such minute records of a
      Byron will be read with interest, even such critics cannot doubt.
      To know that Catiline walked with an agitated and uncertain gait
      is, by no mean judge of human nature, deemed important as an
      indication of character. But far less significant details will
      satisfy the idolaters of genius. To be told that Tasso loved
      malmsey and thought it favourable to poetic inspiration is a
      piece of intelligence, even at the end of three centuries, not
      unwelcome; while a still more amusing proof of the disposition of
      the world to remember little things of the great is, that the
      poet Petrarch's excessive fondness for turnips is one of the few
      traditions still preserved of him at Arqua. <span class=

    </p>
    <p>
      The personal appearance of Lord Byron has been so frequently
      described, both by pen and pencil, that were it not the bounden
      duty of the biographer to attempt some such sketch, the task
      would seem superfluous. Of his face, the beauty may be pronounced
      to have been of the highest order, as combining at once
      regularity of features with the most varied and interesting
      expression. The same facility, indeed, of change observable in
      the movements of his mind was seen also in the free play of his
      features, as the passing thoughts within darkened or shone
      through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, though of a light grey, were capable of all extremes of
      expression, from the most joyous hilarity to the deepest sadness,
      from the very sunshine of benevolence to the most concentrated
      scorn or rage. Of this latter passion, I had once an opportunity
      of seeing what fiery interpreters they could be, on my telling
      him, thoughtlessly enough, that a friend of mine had said to
      me&mdash;"Beware of Lord Byron; he will some day or other do
      something very wicked."&mdash;"Was it man or woman said so?" he
      exclaimed, suddenly turning round upon me with a look of such
      intense anger as, though it lasted not an instant, could not
      easily be forgot, and of which no better idea can be given than
      in the words of one who, speaking of Chatterton's eyes, says that
      "fire rolled at the bottom of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was in the mouth and chin that the great beauty as well as
      expression of his fine countenance lay. "Many pictures have been
      painted of him," <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg254" id=
      "pg254">254</a></span> says a fair critic of his features, "with
      various success; but the excessive beauty of his lips escaped
      every painter and sculptor. In their ceaseless play they
      represented every emotion, whether pale with anger, curled in
      disdain, smiling in triumph, or dimpled with archness and love."
      It would be injustice to the reader not to borrow from the same
      pencil a few more touches of portraiture. "This extreme facility
      of expression was sometimes painful, for I have seen him look
      absolutely ugly&mdash;I have seen him look so hard and cold, that
      you must hate him, and then, in a moment, brighter than the sun,
      with such playful softness in his look, such affectionate
      eagerness kindling in his eyes, and dimpling his lips into
      something more sweet than a smile, that you forgot the man, the
      Lord Byron, in the picture of beauty presented to you, and gazed
      with intense curiosity&mdash;I had almost said&mdash;as if to
      satisfy yourself, that thus looked the god of poetry, the god of
      the Vatican, when he conversed with the sons and daughters of
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was remarkably small<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>,&mdash;so much so as to be rather out of
      proportion with his face. The forehead, though a little too
      narrow, was high, and appeared more so from his having his hair
      (to preserve <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg255" id=
      "pg255">255</a></span> it, as he said,) shaved over the temples;
      while the glossy, dark-brown curls, clustering over his head,
      gave the finish to its beauty. When to this is added, that his
      nose, though handsomely, was rather thickly shaped, that his
      teeth were white and regular, and his complexion colourless, as
      good an idea perhaps as it is in the power of mere words to
      convey may be conceived of his features.

        [Footnote 1: "Several of us, one day," says Colonel Napier,
        "tried on his hat, and in a party of twelve or fourteen, who
        were at dinner, <i>not one</i> could put it on, so exceedingly
        small was his head. My servant, Thomas Wells, who had the
        smallest head in the 90th regiment (so small that he could
        hardly get a cap to fit him), was the only person who could put
        on Lord Byron's hat, and him it fitted exactly."]

      In height he was, as he himself has informed us, five feet eight
      inches and a half, and to the length of his limbs he attributed
      his being such a good swimmer. His hands were very white,
      and&mdash;according to his own notion of the size of hands as
      indicating birth&mdash;aristocratically small. The lameness of
      his right foot<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, though an obstacle
      to grace, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg256" id=
      "pg256">256</a></span> but little impeded the activity of his
      movements; and from this circumstance, as well as from the skill
      with which the foot was disguised by means of long trowsers, it
      would be difficult to conceive a defect of this kind less
      obtruding itself as a deformity; while the diffidence which a
      constant consciousness of the infirmity gave to his first
      approach and address made, in him, even lameness a source of
      interest.

        [Footnote 1: In speaking of this lameness at the commencement
        of my work, I forbore, both from my own doubts on the subject
        and the great variance I found in the recollections of others,
        from stating in <i>which</i> of his feet this lameness existed.
        It will, indeed, with difficulty be believed what uncertainty I
        found upon this point, even among those most intimate with him.
        Mr. Hunt, in his book, states it to have been the left foot
        that was deformed, and this, though contrary to my own
        impression, and, as it appears also, to the fact, was the

        of living with him. On applying to his early friends at
        Southwell and to the shoemaker of that town who worked for him,
        so little prepared were they to answer with any certainty on
        the subject, that it was only by recollecting that the lame
        foot "was the off one in going up the street" they at last came
        to the conclusion that his right limb was the one affected; and
        Mr. Jackson, his preceptor in pugilism, was, in like manner,
        obliged to call to mind whether his noble pupil was a right or
        left hand hitter before he could arrive at the same decision.]

      In looking again into the Journal from which it was my intention
      to give extracts, the following unconnected opinions, or rather
      reveries, most of them on points connected with his religious
      opinions, are all that I feel tempted to select. To an assertion
      in the early part of this work, that "at no time of his life was
      Lord Byron a confirmed unbeliever," it has been objected, that
      many passages of his writings prove the direct contrary. This
      assumption, however, as well as the interpretation of most of the
      passages referred to in its support, proceed, as it appears to
      me, upon the mistake, not uncommon in conversation, of
      confounding together the meanings of the words unbeliever and
      sceptic,&mdash;the former implying decision of opinion, and the
      latter only doubt. I have myself, I find, not always kept the
      significations of the two words distinct, and in one instance
      have so far fallen into the notion of these objectors as to speak
      of Byron in his youth as "an unbelieving school-boy," when the
      word "doubting" would have more truly expressed my meaning. With
      this necessary explanation, I shall here repeat my assertion; or
      rather&mdash;to clothe its substance in a different
      form&mdash;shall say that Lord Byron was, to the last,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg257" id="pg257">257</a></span> a
      sceptic, which, in itself, implies that he was, at no time, a
      confirmed unbeliever.

      In laying before the reader these last extracts from the papers
      in my possession, it may be expected, perhaps, that I should say
      something,&mdash;in addition to what has been already stated on
      this subject,&mdash;respecting those Memoranda, or Memoirs,
      which, in the exercise of the discretionary power given to me by
      my noble friend, I placed, shortly after his death, at the
      disposal of his sister and executor, and which they, from a sense
      of what they thought due to his memory, consigned to the flames.
      As the circumstances, however, connected with the surrender of
      that manuscript, besides requiring much more detail than my
      present limits allow, do not, in any respect, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg264" id="pg264">264</a></span> concern the
      character of Lord Byron, but affect solely my own, it is not
      here, at least, that I feel myself called upon to enter into an
      explanation of them. The world will, of course, continue to think
      of that step as it pleases; but it is, after all, on a man's
      <i>own</i> opinion of his actions that his happiness chiefly
      depends, and I can only say that, were I again placed in the same
      circumstances, I would&mdash;even at ten times the pecuniary
      sacrifice which my conduct then cost me&mdash;again act precisely
      in the same manner.

      For the satisfaction of those whose regret at the loss of that

      disappointment of a prurient curiosity, I shall here add, that on
      the mysterious cause of the separation, it afforded no light
      whatever;&mdash;that, while some of its details could never have
      been published at all<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and little,
      if any, of what it contained personal towards others could have
      appeared till long after the individuals concerned had left the
      scene, all that materially related to Lord Byron himself was (as
      I well knew when I made that sacrifice) to be found repeated in
      the various Journals and Memorandum-books, which, though not all
      to be made use of, were, as the reader has seen from the
      preceding pages, all preserved.

        of the Memoranda; there having been but little unfit for

      As far as suppression, indeed, is blamable, I have had, in the
      course of this task, abundantly to answer for it; having, as the
      reader must have perceived, withheld a large portion of my
      materials, to which Lord Byron, no doubt, in his fearlessness of
      consequences, would have wished to give publicity, but which, it
      is now more than probable, will never meet the light.

    <p>
      There remains little more to add. It has been remarked by Lord
      Orford<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, as "strange, that the
      writing a man's life should in general make the biographer become
      enamoured of his subject, whereas one should think that the nicer
      disquisition one makes into the life of any man, the less reason
      one should find to love or admire him." On the contrary, may we
      not rather say that, as knowledge is ever the parent of
      tolerance, the more insight we gain into the springs and motives
      of a man's actions, the peculiar circumstances in which he was
      placed, and the influences and temptations under which he acted,
      the more allowance we may be inclined to make for his errors, and
      the more approbation his virtues may extort from us?

      The arduous task of being the biographer of Byron is one, at
      least, on which I have not obtruded myself: the wish of my friend
      that I should undertake that office having been more than once
      expressed, at a time when none but a boding imagination like his
      could have foreseen much chance of the sad honour <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg266" id="pg266">266</a></span> devolving to
      me. If in some instances I have consulted rather the spirit than
      the exact letter of his injunctions, it was with the view solely
      of doing him more justice than he would have done himself, there
      being no hands in which his character could have been less safe
      than his own, nor any greater wrong offered to his memory than
      the substitution of what he affected to be for what he was. Of
      any partiality, however, beyond what our mutual friendship
      accounts for and justifies, I am by no means conscious; nor would
      it be in the power, indeed, of even the most partial friend to
      allege any thing more convincingly favourable of his character
      than is contained in the few simple facts with which I shall here
      conclude,&mdash;that, through life, with all his faults, he never
      lost a friend;&mdash;that those about him in his youth, whether
      as companions, teachers, or servants, remained attached to him to
      the last;&mdash;that the woman, to whom he gave the love of his
      maturer years, idolises his name; and that, with a single unhappy
      exception, scarce an instance is to be found of any one, once
      brought, however briefly, into relations of amity with him, that
      did not feel towards him a kind regard in life, and retain a
      fondness for his memory.

    </p>
    <p>
      10 That it behoves not to admit the Prophets.<span class=
      "fnref">[6]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      11 Neither do they affirm the omnipotence of God:
    </p>
    <p>
      12 Neither do they affirm the resurrection of the flesh:
    </p>
    <p>
      13 Neither do they affirm that man was altogether created by God:
    </p>
    <p>
      14 Neither do they affirm that Jesus Christ was born in the flesh
      from the Virgin Mary:
    </p>
    <p>
      15 Neither do they affirm that the world was the work of God, but
      of some one of the angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      16 Therefore do thou make haste<span class="fnref">[7]</span> to
      come amongst us.
    </p>
    <p>
      17 That this city of the Corinthians may remain without scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      18 And that the folly of these men may be made manifest by an
      open refutation. Fare thee well.<span class="fnref">[8]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacons Thereptus and Tichus<span class="fnref">[9]</span>
      received and conveyed this Epistle to the city of the
      Philippians.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      When Paul received the Epistle, although he was then in chains on
      account of Stratonice[11], the wife of Apofolanus[12], yet, as it
      were forgetting his bonds, he mourned over these words, and said,
      weeping: "It were better for me to be dead, and with the Lord.
      For while I am in this body, and hear <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg271" id="pg271">271</a></span> the wretched
      words of such false doctrine, behold, grief arises upon grief,
      and my trouble adds a weight to my chains; when I behold this
      calamity, and progress of the machinations of Satan, who
      searcheth to do wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, with deep affliction, Paul composed his reply to the
      Epistle.[13]

    <h4>
      EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS, <span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      1 Paul, in bonds for Jesus Christ, disturbed by so many errors
      <span class="fnref">[2]</span>, to his Corinthian brethren,
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 I nothing marvel that the preachers of evil have made this
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      3 For because the Lord Jesus is about to fulfil his coming,
      verily on this account do certain men pervert and despise his
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 But I, verily, from the beginning, have taught you that only
      which I myself received from the former apostles, who always
      remained with the Lord Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      5 And I now say unto you, that the Lord Jesus Christ was born of
      the Virgin Mary, who was of the seed of David,
    </p>
    <p>
      6 According to the annunciation of the Holy Ghost, sent to her by
      our Father from heaven;
    </p>
    <p>
      7 That Jesus might be introduced into the world <span class=
      "fnref">[3]</span>, and deliver our flesh by his flesh, and that
      he might raise us up from the dead;
    </p>
    <p>
      8 As in this also he himself became the example:
    </p>
    <p>
      9 That it might be made manifest that man was created by the
      Father,
    </p>
    <p>
      10 He has not remained in perdition unsought <span class=
      "fnref">[4]</span>; <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg272" id=
      "pg272">272</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      11 But he is sought for, that he might be revived by adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      12 For God, who is the Lord of all, the Father of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, who made heaven and earth, sent, firstly, the Prophets to
      the Jews:
    </p>
    <p>
      13 That he would absolve them from their sins, and bring them to
      his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      14 Because he wished to save, firstly, the house of Israel, he
      bestowed and poured forth his Spirit upon the Prophets;
    </p>
    <p>
      15 That they should, for a long time, preach the worship of God,
      and the nativity of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      16 But he who was the prince of evil, when he wished to make
      himself God, laid his hand upon them,
    </p>
    <p>
      17 And bound all men in sin,<span class="fnref">[5]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      18 Because the judgment of the world was approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      19 But Almighty God, when he willed to justify, was unwilling to
      abandon his creature;
    </p>
    <p>
      20 But when he saw his affliction, he had compassion upon him:
    </p>
    <p>
      21 And at the end of a time he sent the Holy Ghost into the
      Virgin foretold by the Prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
      22 Who, believing readily <span class="fnref">[6]</span>, was
      made worthy to conceive, and bring forth our Lord Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      23 That from this perishable body, in which the evil spirit was
      glorified, he should be cast out, and it should be made manifest
    </p>
    <p>
      24 That he was not God: For Jesus Christ, in his flesh, had
      recalled and saved this perishable flesh, and drawn it into
      eternal life by faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      25 Because in his body he would prepare a pure temple of justice
      for all ages;
    </p>
    <p>
      26 In whom we also, when we believe, are saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      27 Therefore know ye that these men are not the children of
      justice, but the children of wrath;
    </p>
    <p>
      28 Who turn away from themselves the compassion of God;
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg273" id="pg273">273</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      29 Who say that neither the heavens nor the earth were altogether
      works made by the hand of the Father of all things.<span class=
      "fnref">[7]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      30 But these cursed men<span class="fnref">[8]</span> have the
      doctrine of the serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      31 But do ye, by the power of God, withdraw yourselves far from
      these, and expel from amongst you the doctrine of the wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      32 Because you are not the children of rebellion <span class=
      "fnref">[9]</span>; but the sons of the beloved church.
    </p>
    <p>
      33 And on this account the time of the resurrection is preached
      to all men.
    </p>
    <p>
      34 Therefore they who affirm that there is no resurrection of the
      flesh, they indeed shall not be raised up to eternal life;
    </p>
    <p>
      35 But to judgment and condemnation shall the unbeliever arise in
      the flesh:
    </p>
    <p>
      36 For to that body which denies the resurrection of the body,
      shall be denied the resurrection: because such are found to
      refuse the resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      37 But you also, Corinthians! have known, from the seeds of
      wheat, and from other seeds,
    </p>
    <p>
      38 That one grain falls [10] dry into the earth, and within it
      first dies,
    </p>
    <p>
      39 And afterwards rises again, by the will of the Lord, endued
      with the same body:
    </p>
    <p>
      40 Neither indeed does it arise with the same simple body, but
      manifold, and filled with blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      41 But we produce the example not only from seeds, but from the
      honourable bodies of men. [11]
    </p>
    <p>
      42 Ye have also known Jonas, the son of Amittai.[12]
    </p>
    <p>
      43 Because he delayed to preach to the Ninevites, he was
      swallowed up in the belly of a fish for three days and three
      nights: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg274" id=
      "pg274">274</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      44 And after three days God heard his supplication, and brought
      him out of the deep abyss;
    </p>
    <p>
      45 Neither was any part of his body corrupted; neither was his
      eyebrow bent down.[13]
    </p>
    <p>
      46 And how much more for you, oh men of little faith;
    </p>
    <p>
      47 If you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, will he raise you up,
      even as he himself hath arisen.
    </p>
    <p>
      48 If the bones of Elisha the prophet, falling upon the dead,
      revived the dead,
    </p>
    <p>
      49 By how much more shall ye, who are supported by the flesh and
      the blood and the Spirit of Christ, arise again on that day with
      a perfect body?
    </p>
    <p>
      50 Elias the prophet, embracing the widow's son, raised him from
      the dead:
    </p>
    <p>
      51 By how much more shall Jesus Christ revive you, on that day,
      with a perfect body, even as he himself hath arisen?
    </p>
    <p>
      52 But if ye receive other things vainly [14],
    </p>
    <p>
      53 Henceforth no one shall cause me to travail; for I bear on my
      body these fetters [15],
    </p>
    <p>
      54 To obtain Christ; and I suffer with patience these afflictions
      to become worthy of the resurrection of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      55 And do each of you, having received the law from the hands of
      the blessed Prophets and the holy gospel [16], firmly maintain
      it;
    </p>
    <p>
      56 To the end that you may be rewarded in the resurrection of the
      dead, and the possession of the life eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      57 But if any of ye, not believing, shall trespass, he shall be
      judged with the misdoers, and punished with those who have false
      belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      58 Because such are the generation of vipers, and the children of
      dragons and basilisks. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg275" id=
      "pg275">275</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      59 Drive far from amongst ye, and fly from such, with the aid of
      our Lord Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      60 And the peace and grace of the beloved Son be upon you.[17]
      Amen.

    <h3>
      REMARKS ON MR. MOORE'S LIFE OF LORD BYRON, BY LADY BYRON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "I have disregarded various publications in which facts within my
      own knowledge have been grossly misrepresented; but I am called
      upon to notice some of the erroneous statements proceeding from
      one who claims to be considered as Lord Byron's confidential and
      authorised friend. Domestic details ought not to be intruded on
      the public attention: if, however, they <i>are</i> so intruded,
      the persons affected by them have a right to refute injurious
      charges. Mr. Moore has promulgated his own impressions of private
      events in which I was most nearly concerned, as if he possessed a
      competent knowledge of the subject. Having survived Lord Byron, I
      feel increased reluctance to advert to any circumstances
      connected with the period of my marriage; nor is it now my
      intention to disclose them, further than may be indispensably
      requisite for <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg276" id=
      "pg276">276</a></span> the end I have in view. Self-vindication
      is not the motive which actuates me to make this appeal, and the
      spirit of accusation is unmingled with it; but when the conduct
      of my parents is brought forward in a disgraceful light, by the
      passages selected from Lord Byron's letters, and by the remarks
      of his biographer, I feel bound to justify their characters from
      imputations which I <i>know</i> to be false. The passages from
      Lord Byron's letters, to which I refer, are the aspersion on my
      mother's character (vol. iii. p. 206. last line):&mdash;'My child
      is very well, and flourishing, I hear; but I must see also. I
      feel no disposition to resign it to the <i>contagian of its
      grandmother's society</i>.' The assertion of her dishonourable
      conduct in employing a spy (vol. iii. p. 202. l. 20, &amp;c.), 'A
      Mrs. C. (now a kind of housekeeper and <i>spy of Lady N</i>'s),
      who, in her better days, was a washerwoman, is supposed to
      be&mdash;by the learned&mdash;very much the occult cause of our
      domestic discrepancies.' The seeming exculpation of myself, in
      the extract (vol. iii. p. 205.), with the words immediately
      following it,&mdash;'Her nearest relatives are a &mdash;&mdash;;'
      where the blank clearly implies something too offensive for
      publication. These passages tend to throw suspicion on my
      parents, and give reason to ascribe the separation either to
      their direct agency, or to that of 'officious spies' employed by
      them.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> From the following part of
      the narrative (vol. iii. p. 198.) it must also be inferred that
      an undue influence was exercised by them for the accomplishment
      of this purpose. 'It was in a few weeks after the latter
      communication between us (Lord Byron and Mr. Moore), that Lady
      Byron adopted the determination of parting from him. She had left
      London at the latter end of January, on a visit to her father's
      house, in Leicestershire, and Lord Byron was in a short time to
      follow her. They had parted in the utmost kindness,&mdash;she
      wrote him a letter full of playfulness and affection, on the
      road; and immediately on her arrival at Kirkby Mallory, her
      father wrote to acquaint Lord Byron that she would return to him
      no more.' In my observations upon this statement, I shall, as far
      as possible, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg277" id=
      "pg277">277</a></span> avoid touching on any matters relating
      personally to Lord Byron and myself. The facts are:&mdash;I left
      London for Kirkby Mallory, the residence of my father and mother,
      on the 15th of January, 1816. Lord Byron had signified to me in
      writing (Jan. 6th) his absolute desire that I should leave London
      on the earliest day that I could conveniently fix. It was not
      safe for me to undertake the fatigue of a journey sooner than the
      15th. Previously to my departure, it had been strongly impressed
      on my mind, that Lord Byron was under the influence of insanity.
      This opinion was derived in a great measure from the
      communications made to me by his nearest relatives and personal
      attendant, who had more opportunities than myself of observing
      him during the latter part of my stay in town. It was even
      represented to me that he was in danger of destroying himself.
      <i>With the concurrence of his family</i>, I had consulted Dr.
      Baillie, as a friend (Jan. 8th), respecting this supposed malady.
      On acquainting him with the state of the case, and with Lord
      Byron's desire that I should leave London, Dr. Baillie thought
      that my absence might be advisable as an experiment,
      <i>assuming</i> the fact of mental derangement; for Dr. Baillie,
      not having had access to Lord Byron, could not pronounce a
      positive opinion on that point. He enjoined, that in
      correspondence with Lord Byron, I should avoid all but light and
      soothing topics. Under these impressions, I left London,
      determined to follow the advice given by Dr. Baillie. Whatever
      might have been the nature of Lord Byron's conduct towards me
      from the time of my marriage, yet, supposing him to be in a state
      of mental alienation, it was not for <i>me</i>, nor for any
      person of common humanity, to manifest, at that moment, a sense
      of injury. On the day of my departure, and again on my arrival at
      Kirkby, Jan. 16th, I wrote to Lord Byron in a kind and cheerful
      tone, according to those medical directions. The last letter was
      circulated, and employed as a pretext for the charge of my having
      been subsequently <i>influenced</i> to 'desert<span class=
      "fnref">[2]</span>' my husband. It has been argued, that I parted
      from Lord Byron in perfect <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg278"
      id="pg278">278</a></span> harmony; that feelings, incompatible
      with any deep sense of injury, had dictated the letter which I
      addressed to him; and that my sentiments must have been changed
      by persuasion and interference, when I was under the roof of my
      parents. These assertions and inferences are wholly destitute of
      foundation. When I arrived at Kirkby Mallory, my parents were
      unacquainted with the existence of any causes likely to destroy
      my prospects of happiness; and when I communicated to them the
      opinion which had been formed concerning Lord Byron's state of
      mind, they were most anxious to promote his restoration by every
      means in their power. They assured those relations who were with
      him in London, that 'they would devote their whole care and
      attention to the alleviation of his malady,' and hoped to make
      the best arrangements for his comfort, if he could be induced to
      visit them. With these intentions, my mother wrote on the 17th to
      Lord Byron, inviting him to Kirkby Mallory. She had always
      treated him with an affectionate consideration and indulgence,
      which extended to every little peculiarity of his feelings. Never
      did an irritating word escape her lips in her whole intercourse
      with him. The accounts given me after I left Lord Byron by the
      persons in constant intercourse with him, added to those doubts
      which had before transiently occurred to my mind, as to the
      reality of the alleged disease, and the reports of his medical
      attendant, were far from establishing the existence of any thing
      like lunacy. Under this uncertainty, I deemed it right to
      communicate to my parents, that if I were to consider Lord
      Byron's past conduct as that of a person of sound mind, nothing
      could induce me to return to him. It therefore appeared
      expedient, both to them and myself, to consult the ablest
      advisers. For that object, and also to obtain still further
      information respecting the appearances which seemed to indicate
      mental derangement, my mother determined to go to London. She was
      empowered by me to take legal opinions on a written statement of
      mine, though I had then reasons for reserving a part of the case
      from the knowledge even of my father and mother. Being convinced
      by the result of these enquiries, and by the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg279" id="pg279">279</a></span> tenor of Lord
      Byron's proceedings, that the notion of insanity was an illusion,
      I no longer hesitated to authorise such measures as were
      necessary, in order to secure me from being ever again placed in
      his power. Conformably with this resolution, my father wrote to
      him on the 2d of February, to propose an amicable separation.
      Lord Byron at first rejected this proposal; but when it was
      distinctly notified to him, that if he persisted in his refusal,
      recourse must be had to legal measures, he agreed to sign a deed
      of separation. Upon applying to Dr. Lushington, who was
      intimately acquainted with all the circumstances, to state in
      writing what he recollected upon this subject, I received from
      him the following letter, by which it will be manifest that my
      mother cannot have been actuated by any hostile or ungenerous
      motives towards Lord Byron.

    </p>
    <p>
      "'I can rely upon the accuracy of my memory for the following
      statement. I was originally consulted by Lady Noel on your
      behalf, whilst you were in the country; the circumstances
      detailed by her were such as justified a separation, but they
      were not of that aggravated description as to render such a
      measure indispensable. On Lady Noel's representation, I deemed a
      reconciliation with Lord Byron practicable, and felt most
      sincerely a wish to aid in effecting it. There was not on Lady
      Noel's part any exaggeration of the facts; nor, so far as I could
      perceive, any determination to prevent a return to Lord Byron:
      certainly none was expressed when I spoke of a reconciliation.
      When you came to town in about a fortnight, or perhaps more,
      after my first interview with Lady Noel, I was, for the first
      time, informed by you of facts utterly unknown, as I have no
      doubt, to Sir Ralph and Lady Noel. On receiving this additional
      information, my opinion was entirely changed: I considered a
      reconciliation impossible. I declared my opinion, and added, that
      if such an idea should be entertained, I could not, either
      professionally or otherwise, take any part towards effecting it.
      Believe me, very faithfully yours, STEPH. LUSHINGTON.

      have only to observe, that if the statements on which my legal
      advisers (the late Sir Samuel Komilly and Dr. Lushington) formed
      their opinions were false, the responsibility and the odium
      should rest with <i>me only</i>. I trust that the facts which I
      have here briefly recapitulated will absolve my father and mother
      from all accusations with regard to the part they took in the
      separation between Lord Byron and myself. They neither
      originated, instigated, nor advised, that separation; and they
      cannot be condemned for having afforded to their daughter the
      assistance and protection which she claimed. There is no other
      near relative to vindicate their memory from insult. I am
      therefore compelled to break the silence which I had hoped always
      to observe, and to solicit from the readers of Lord Byron's life
      an impartial consideration of the testimony extorted from me.

      "Eight months after the publication of my 'Tour in the Levant,'

      of the newspapers, a letter from the late Lord Byron to Mr.
      Murray.

      "I naturally felt anxious at the time to meet a charge of error
      brought against me in so direct a manner: but I thought, and
      friends whom I consulted at the time thought with me, that I had
      better wait for a more favourable opportunity than that afforded
      by the newspapers of vindicating my opinion, which even so
      distinguished an authority as the letter of Lord Byron left
      unshaken, and which, I will venture to add, remains unshaken

      scrupulously confining myself to such facts and illustrations as

      "To the above citations, I will add the opinion of Tournefort,
      who, in his description of the strait, expresses with ridicule
      his disbelief of the truth of Leander's exploit; and to show that
      the latest travellers agree with the earlier, I will conclude my
      quotation with a statement of Mr. Madden, who is just returned
      from the spot. 'It was from the European side Lord Byron swam
      <i>with</i> the current, which runs about four miles an hour. But
      I believe he would have found it totally impracticable to have
      crossed from Abydos to Europe.'&mdash;MADDEN'S <i>Travels</i>,
      vol. i.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are two other observations in Lord Byron's letter on which
      I feel it necessary to remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mr. Turner says, "Whatever is thrown into the stream on this
      part of the European bank <i>must</i> arrive at the Asiatic
      shore." This is so far from being the case, that it <i>must</i>
      arrive in the Archipelago, if left to the current, although a
      strong wind from the Asiatic<span class="fnref">[1]</span> side
      might have such an effect occasionally.'

        [Footnote 1: "This is evidently a mistake of the writer or
        printer. His Lordship must here have meant a strong wind from
        the European side, as no wind from the Asiatic side could have
        the effect of driving an object to the Asiatic shore."
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it right to remark, that it is Mr. Turner himself who
        has here originated the inaccuracy of which he accuses others;
        the words used by Lord Byron being, <i>not</i>, as Mr. Turner
        says, "from the Asiatic side," but "in the Asiatic
        direction."&mdash;T. M.]

      "Here Lord Byron is right, and I have no hesitation in confessing
      that I was wrong. But I was wrong only in the letter of my
      remark, not in the spirit of it. Any <i>thing</i> thrown into the
      stream on the European bank would be swept into the Archipelago,
      because, after arriving so near the Asiatic-shore as to be
      almost, if not quite, within a man's depth, it would be again
      floated off from the coast by the current that is dashed from the
      Asiatic promontory. But this would not affect a swimmer, who,
      being so near the land, would of course, if he could not actually
      walk to it, reach it by a slight effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Byron adds, in his P.S. 'The strait is, however, not
      extraordinarily wide, even where it broadens above and below the
      forts.' From this statement I must venture to express my dissent,
      with diffidence indeed, but with diffidence diminished by the
      ease with which the fact may be established. The strait is
      widened so considerably above the forts by the Bay of Maytos, and
      the bay opposite to it on the Asiatic coast, that the distance to
      be passed by a swimmer in crossing higher up would be, in my poor
      judgment, too great for any one to accomplish from Asia to
      Europe, having such a current to stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I conclude by expressing it as my humble opinion that no one is
      bound to believe in the possibility of Leander's exploit, till
      the passage has been performed by a swimmer, at least from Asia
      to Europe. The sceptic is even entitled to exact, as the
      condition of his belief, that the strait be crossed, as Leander
      crossed it, both ways within at most fourteen hours.

      MR. MILLINGEN'S ACCOUNT OF THE CONSULTATION.
    </h3>
    <h4>
      <i>Referred to in</i> vol. vi. p. 209.
    </h4>
    <p>
      As the account given by Mr. Millingen of this consultation
      differs totally from that of Dr. Bruno, it is fit that the reader
      should have it in Mr. Millingen's own words:&mdash; <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg284" id="pg284">284</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the morning (18th) a consultation was proposed, to which Dr.
      Lucca Vega and Dr. Freiber, my assistants, were invited. Dr.
      Bruno and Lucca proposed having recourse to antispasmodics and
      other remedies employed in the last stage of typhus. Freiber and
      I maintained that they could only hasten the fatal termination,
      that nothing could be more empirical than flying from one extreme
      to the other; that if, as we all thought, the complaint was owing
      to the metastasis of rheumatic inflammation, the existing
      symptoms only depended on the rapid and extensive progress it had
      made in an organ previously so weakened and irritable.
      Antiphlogistic means could never prove hurtful in this case; they
      would become useless only if disorganisation were already
      operated; but then, since all hopes were gone, what means would
      not prove superfluous? We recommended the application of numerous
      leeches to the temples, behind the ears, and along the course of
      the jugular vein; a large blister between the shoulders, and
      sinapisms to the feet, as affording, though feeble, yet the last
      hopes of success. Dr. B., being the patient's physician, had the
      casting vote, and prepared the antispasmodic potion which Dr.
      Lucca and he had agreed upon; it was a strong infusion of
      valerian and ether, &amp;c. After its administration, the
      convulsive movement, the delirium increased; but, notwithstanding
      my representations, a second dose was given half an hour after.
      After articulating confusedly a few broken phrases, the patient
      sunk shortly after into a comatose sleep, which the next day
      terminated in death. He expired on the 19th of April, at six
      o'clock in the afternoon."

      stocks or funds, or upon government or real security at interest,

      securities, and from time to time during the life of my sister
      Augusta Mary Leigh, the wife of George Leigh, Esquire, pay,
      receive, apply, and dispose of the interest, dividends, and
      annual produce thereof, when and as the same shall become due and
      payable, into the proper hands of the said Augusta Mary Leigh, to
      and for her sole and separate use and benefit, free from the
      control, debts, or engagements of her present or any future
      husband, or unto such person or persons as she my said sister
      shall from time to time, by any writing under her hand,
      notwithstanding her <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg287" id=
      "pg287">287</a></span> present or any future coverture, and
      whether covert or sole, direct or appoint; and from and
      immediately after the decease of my said sister, then upon trust,
      that they my said trustees and the survivor of them, his
      executors or administrators, do and shall assign and transfer all
      my said personal estate and other the trust property hereinbefore
      mentioned, or the stocks, funds, or securities wherein or upon
      which the same shall or may be placed out or invested, unto and
      among all and every the child and children of my said sister, if
      more than one, in such parts, shares, and proportions, and to
      become a vested interest, and to be paid and transferred at such
      time and times, and in such manner, and with, under, and subject
      to such provisions, conditions, and restrictions, as my said
      sister, at any time during her life, whether covert or sole, by
      any deed or deeds, instrument or instruments, in writing, with or
      without power of revocation, to be sealed and delivered in the
      presence of two or more credible witnesses, or by her last will
      and testament in writing, or any writing of appointment in the
      nature of a will, shall direct or appoint; and in default of any
      such appointment, or in case of the death of my said sister in my
      lifetime, then upon trust that they my said trustees and the
      survivor of them, his executors, administrators, and assigns, do
      and shall assign and transfer all the trust, property, and funds
      unto and among the children of my said sister, if more than one,
      equally to be divided between them, share and share alike, and if
      only one such child, then to such only child the share and shares
      of such of them as shall be a son or sons, to be paid and
      transferred unto him and them when and as he or they shall
      respectively attain his or their age or ages of twenty-one years;
      and the share and shares of such of them as shall be a daughter
      or daughters, to be paid and transferred unto her or them when
      and as she or they shall respectively attain her or their age or
      ages of twenty-one years, or be married, which shall first
      happen; and in case any of such children shall happen to die,
      being a son or sons, before he or they shall attain the age of
      twenty-one years, or being a daughter or daughters, before she or
      they shall attain the said age of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg288" id="pg288">288</a></span> twenty-one, or be married; then
      it is my will and I do direct that the share and shares of such
      of the said children as shall so die shall go to the survivor or
      survivors of such children, with the benefit of further accruer
      in case of the death of any such surviving children before their
      shares shall become vested. And I do direct that my said trustees
      shall pay and apply the interest and dividends of each of the
      said children's shares in the said trust funds for his, her, or
      their maintenance and education during their minorities,
      notwithstanding their shares may not become vested interests, but
      that such interest and dividends as shall not have been so
      applied shall accumulate, and follow, and go over with the
      principal. And I do nominate, constitute, and appoint the said
      John Cam Hobhouse and John Hanson executors of this my will. And
      I do will and direct that my said trustees shall not be
      answerable the one of them for the other of them, or for the
      acts, deeds, receipts, or defaults of the other of them, but each
      of them for his own acts, deeds, receipts, and wilful defaults
      only, and that they my said trustees shall be entitled to retain
      and deduct out of the monies which shall come to their hands
      under the trusts aforesaid all such costs, charges, damages, and
      expenses which they or any of them shall bear, pay, sustain, or
      be put unto, in the execution and performance of the trusts
      herein reposed in them. I make the above provision for my sister
      and her children, in consequence of my dear wife Lady Byron, and
      any children I may have, being otherwise amply provided for; and,
      lastly, I do revoke all former wills by me at any time heretofore
      made, and do declare this only to be my last will and testament.
      In witness whereof, I have to this my last will, contained in
      three sheets of paper, set my hand to the first two sheets
      thereof, and to this third and last sheet my hand and seal this

      CODICIL.&mdash;This is a Codicil to the last will and testament
      of me, the Right Honourable George Gordon, Lord Byron. I give and
      bequeath unto Allegra Biron, an infant of about twenty months
      old, by me brought up, and now residing at Venice, the sum of
      five thousand pounds, which I direct the executors of my said
      will to pay to her on her attaining the age of twenty-one years,
      or on the day of her marriage, on condition that she does not
      marry with a native of Great Britain, which shall first happen.
      And I direct my said executors, as soon as conveniently may be
      after my decease, to invest the said sum of five thousand pounds
      upon government or real security, and to pay and apply the annual
      income thereof in or towards the maintenance and education of the

      become part of the residue of my personal estate, and in all
      other respects I do confirm my said will, and declare this to be
      a codicil thereto. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my

      REVIEW OF WORDSWORTH'S POEMS,
    </h2>
    <h4>
      2 Vols. 1807.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </h4>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: I have been a reviewer. In 1807, in a Magazine
        called "Monthly Literary Recreations," I reviewed Wordsworth's
        trash of that time. In the Monthly Review I wrote some articles
        which were inserted. This was in the latter part of
        1811.&mdash;BYRON.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      (From "Monthly Literary Recreations," for August, 1807.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The volumes before us are by the author of Lyrical Ballads, a
      collection which has not undeservedly met with a considerable
      share of public applause. The characteristics of Mr. W.'s muse
      are simple and flowing, though occasionally inharmonious verse,
      strong, and sometimes irresistible appeals to the feelings, with
      unexceptionable sentiments. Though the present work may not equal
      his former efforts, many of the poems possess a native elegance,
      natural and unaffected, totally devoid of the tinsel
      embellishments and abstract hyperboles of several contemporary
      sonneteers. The last sonnet in the first volume, p. 152., is
      perhaps the best, without any novelty in the sentiments, which we
      hope are common to every Briton at the present crisis; the force
      and expression is that of a genuine poet, feeling as he
      writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Another year! another deadly blow!
      </p>
      <p>
        Another mighty empire overthrown!

      <p>
        And we are left, or shall be left, alone&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        The last that dares to struggle with the foe.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Tis well!&mdash;from this day forward we shall know
      </p>
      <p>
        That in ourselves our safety must be sought,
      </p>
      <p>
        That by our own right-hands it must be wrought;
      </p>
      <p>
        That we must stand unprop'd, or be laid low.
      </p>
      <p>
        O dastard! whom such foretaste doth not cheer!
      </p>
      <p>
        We shall exult, if they who rule the land

      <p>
        Wise, upright, valiant, not a venal band,
      </p>
      <p>
        Who are to judge of danger which they fear,
      </p>
      <p>
        And honour which they do not understand."

    <p>
      The song at the Feast of Brougham Castle, the Seven Sisters, the
      Affliction of Margaret &mdash;&mdash; of &mdash;&mdash;, possess
      all the beauties, and few of the defects, of this writer: the
      following lines from the last are in his first style:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Ah! little doth the young one dream
      </p>
      <p>
        When full of play and childish cares,
      </p>
      <p>
        What power hath e'en his wildest scream,
      </p>
      <p>
        Heard by his mother unawares:
      </p>
      <p>
        He knows it not, he cannot guess:
      </p>
      <p>
        Years to a mother bring distress,
      </p>
      <p>
        But do not make her love the less."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The pieces least worthy of the author are those entitled "Moods
      of my own Mind." We certainly wish these "Moods" had been less
      frequent, or not permitted to occupy a place near works which
      only make their deformity more obvious; when Mr. W. ceases to
      please, it is by "abandoning" his mind to the most commonplace
      ideas, at the same time clothing them in language not simple, but
      puerile. What will any reader or auditor, out of the nursery, say
      to such namby-pamby as "Lines written at the Foot of Brother's
      Bridge?"

      "The plough-boy is whooping anon, anon," &amp;c. &amp;c. is in
      the same exquisite measure. This appears to us neither more nor
      less than an imitation of such minstrelsy as soothed our cries in
      the cradle, with the shrill ditty of

    <p>
      On the whole, however, with the exception of the above, and other
      INNOCENT odes of the same cast, we think these volumes display a
      genius worthy of higher pursuits, and regret that Mr. W. confines
      his muse to such trifling subjects. We trust his motto will be in
      future, "Paulo majora canamus." Many, with inferior abilities,
      have acquired a loftier seat on Parnassus, merely by attempting
      strains in which Mr. Wordsworth is more qualified to
      excel.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

        [Footnote 1: This first attempt of Lord Byron at reviewing is
        remarkable only as showing how plausibly he could assume the
        established tone and phraseology of these minor judgment-seats
        of criticism. If Mr. Wordsworth ever chanced to cast his eye
        over this article, how little could he have expected that under
        that dull prosaic mask lurked one who, in five short years from
        thence, would rival even <i>him</i> in poetry!&mdash;MOORE.]

      REVIEW OF GELL'S GEOGRAPHY OF ITHACA, AND ITINERARY OF GREECE.
    </h2>
    <h4>
      (From the "Monthly Review" for August, 1811.)
    </h4>
    <p>
      That laudable curiosity concerning the remains of classical
      antiquity, which has of late years increased among our
      countrymen, is in no traveller or author more conspicuous than in
      Mr. Gell. Whatever difference of opinion may yet exist with
      regard to the success of the several disputants in the famous
      Trojan controversy<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, or, indeed,
      relating to the present author's merits as an inspector of the
      Troad, it must universally be acknowledged that any work, which
      more forcibly impresses on our imaginations the scenes of heroic
      action, and the subjects of immortal song, possesses claims on
      the attention of every scholar.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: We have it from the best authority that the
        venerable leader of the Anti-Homeric sect, Jacob Bryant,
        several years before his death, expressed regret for his
        ungrateful attempt to destroy some of the most pleasing
        associations of our youthful studies. One of his last wishes
        was&mdash;"<i>Trojaque nunc stares," &amp;c.</i>]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Of the two works which now demand our report, we conceive the
      former to be by far the most interesting to the reader, as the
      latter is indisputably the most serviceable to the traveller.
      Excepting, indeed, the running commentary which it contains on a
      number of extracts from Pausanias and Strabo, it is, as the title
      imports, a mere itinerary of Greece, or rather of Argolis only,
      in its present circumstances. This being the case, surely it
      would have answered every purpose of utility much better by being
      printed as a pocket road-book of that part of the Morea; for a
      quarto is a very unmanageable travelling companion. The
      maps<span class="fnref">[1]</span> and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg297" id="pg297">297</a></span> drawings, we
      shall be told, would not permit such an arrangement: but as to
      the drawings, they are not in general to be admired as specimens
      of the art; and several of them, as we have been assured by
      eye-witnesses of the scenes which they describe, do not
      compensate for their mediocrity in point of execution, by any
      extraordinary fidelity of representation. Others, indeed, are
      more faithful, according to our informants. The true reason,
      however, for this costly mode of publication is in course to be
      found in a desire of gratifying the public passion for large
      margins, and all the luxury of typography; and we have before
      expressed our dissatisfaction with Mr. Gell's aristocratical mode
      of communicating a species of knowledge, which ought to be
      accessible to a much greater portion of classical students than
      can at present acquire it by his means:&mdash;but, as such
      expostulations are generally useless, we shall be thankful for
      what we can obtain, and that in the manner in which Mr. Gell has
      chosen to present it.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Or, rather, <i>Map</i>; for we have only one in
        the volume, and that is on too small a scale to give more than
        a general idea of the relative position of places. The excuse
        about a larger map not folding well is trifling; see, for
        instance, the author's own map of Ithaca.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The former of these volumes, we have observed, is the most
      attractive in the closet. It comprehends a very full survey of
      the far-famed island which the hero of the Odyssey has
      immortalized; for we really are inclined to think that the author
      has established the identity of the modern <i>Theaki</i> with the
      <i>Ithaca</i> of Homer. At all events, if it be an illusion, it
      is a very agreeable deception, and is effected by an ingenious
      interpretation of the passages in Homer that are supposed to be
      descriptive of the scenes which our traveller has visited. We
      shall extract some of these adaptations of the ancient picture to
      the modern scene, marking the points of resemblance which appear
      to be strained and forced, as well as those which are more easy
      and natural: but we must first insert some preliminary matter
      from the opening chapter. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg298"
      id="pg298">298</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following passage conveys a sort of general sketch of the
      book, which may give our readers a tolerably adequate notion of
      its contents:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The present work may adduce, by a simple and correct survey of
        the island, coincidences in its geography, in its natural
        productions, and moral state, before unnoticed. Some will be
        directly pointed out; the fancy or ingenuity of the reader may
        be employed in tracing others; the mind familiar with the
        imagery of the Odyssey will recognise with satisfaction the
        scenes themselves; and this volume is offered to the public,
        not entirely without hopes of vindicating the poem of Homer
        from the scepticism of those critics who imagine that the
        Odyssey is a mere poetical composition, unsupported by history,
        and unconnected with the localities of any particular
        situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Some have asserted that, in the comparison of places now
        existing with the descriptions of Homer, we ought not to expect
        coincidence in minute details; yet it seems only by these that
        the kingdom of Ulysses, or any other, can be identified, as, if
        such as idea be admitted, every small and rocky island in the
        Ionian Sea, containing a good port, might, with equal
        plausibility, assume the appellation of Ithaca.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Venetian geographers have in a great degree contributed to
        raise those doubts which have existed on the identity of the
        modern with the ancient Ithaca, by giving, in their charts, the
        name of Val di Compare to the island. That name is, however,
        totally unknown in the country, where the isle is invariably
        called Ithaca by the upper ranks, and Theaki by the vulgar. The
        Venetians have equally corrupted the name of almost every place
        in Greece; yet, as the natives of Epactos or Naupactos never
        heard of Lepanto, those of Zacynthos of Zante, or the Athenians
        of Settines, it would be as unfair to rob Ithaca of its name,
        on such authority, as it would be to assert that no such island
        existed, because no tolerable representation of its form can be
        found in the Venetian surveys.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The rare medals of the Island, of which three are represented
        in the title-page, might be adduced as a proof that the name of
        Ithaca was not lost during the reigns of the Roman emperors.
        They have the head of Ulysses, recognised by the pileum, or
        pointed cap, while the reverse of one presents the figure of a
        cock, the emblem of his vigilance, with the legend [Greek:
        ITHAKON]. A few of these medals are preserved in the cabinets
        of the curious, and one also, with the cock, found in the
        island, is in the possession of Signor Zavo, of Bathi. The
        uppermost <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg299" id=
        "pg299">299</a></span> coin is in the collection of Dr. Hunter;
        the second is copied from Newman, and the third is the property
        of R.P. Knight, Esq.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Several inscriptions, which will be hereafter produced, will
        tend to the confirmation of the idea that Ithaca was inhabited
        about the time when the Romans were masters of Greece; yet
        there is every reason to believe that few, if any, of the
        present proprietors of the soil are descended from ancestors
        who had long resided successively in the island. Even those who
        lived, at the time of Ulysses, in Ithaca, seem to have been on
        the point of emigrating to Argos, and no chief remained, after
        the second in descent from that hero, worthy of being recorded
        in history. It appears that the isle has been twice colonised
        from Cephalonia in modern times, and I was informed that a
        grant had been made by the Venetians, entitling each settler in
        Ithaca to as much land as his circumstances would enable him to
        cultivate."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Gell then proceeds to invalidate the authority of previous
      writers on the subject of Ithaca. Sir George Wheeler and M. le
      Chevalier fall under his severe animadversion; and, indeed,
      according to his account, neither of these gentlemen had visited
      the island, and the description of the latter is "absolutely too
      absurd for refutation." In another place, he speaks of M. le C.
      "disgracing a work of such merit by the introduction of such
      fabrications;" again, of the inaccuracy of the author's maps;
      and, lastly, of his inserting an island at the southern entry of
      the Channel between Cephalonia and Ithaca, which has no
      existence. This observation very nearly approaches to the use of
      that monosyllable which Gibbon<span class="fnref">[1]</span>,
      without expressing it, so adroitly applied to some assertion of
      his antagonist, Mr. Davies. In truth, our traveller's words are
      rather bitter towards his brother tourist: but we must conclude
      that their justice warrants their severity.

    <p>
      In the second chapter, the author describes his landing in
      Ithaca, and arrival at the rock Korax and the fountain Arethusa,
      as he designates it with sufficient positiveness.&mdash;This

      extracts from Mr. Gell some of the passages in Homer to which he
      <i>refers</i> only, conceiving this to be the fairest method of
      exhibiting the strength or the weakness of his argument.
      "Ulysses," he observes, "came to the extremity of the isle to
      visit Eumusæ, and that extremity was the most southern; for
      Telemachus, coming from Pylos, touched at the first south-eastern
      part of Ithaca with the same intention."

      These citations, we think, appear to justify the author in his
      attempt to identify the situation of his rock and fountain with
      the place of those mentioned by Homer. But let us now follow him
      in the closer description of the scene.&mdash;After some account
      of the subjects in the plate affixed, Mr. Gell remarks: "It is
      impossible to visit this sequestered spot without being struck
      with the recollection of the Fount of Arethusa and the Rock
      Korax, which the poet mentions in the same line, adding, that
      there the swine eat the <i>sweet</i><span class=

      "Having passed some time at the fountain, taken a drawing, and
      made the necessary observations on the situation of the place, we
      proceeded to an examination of the precipice, climbing over the
      terraces above the source, among shady fig-trees, which, however,
      did not prevent us from feeling the powerful effects of the
      mid-day sun. After a short but fatiguing ascent, we arrived at
      the rock, which extends in a vast perpendicular semicircle,
      beautifully fringed with trees, facing to the southeast. Under
      the crag we found two caves of inconsiderable extent, the
      entrance of one of which, not difficult of access, is seen in the
      view of the fount. They are still the resort of sheep and goats,
      and in one of them are small natural receptacles for the water,
      covered by a stalagmitic incrustation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These caves, being at the extremity of the curve formed by the
      precipice, open toward the south, and present us with another
      accompaniment of the fount of Arethusa, mentioned by the poet,
      who informs us that the swineherd Eumæus left his guests in the
      house, whilst he, putting on a thick garment, went to sleep near
      the herd, under the hollow of the rock, which sheltered him from
      the northern blast. Now we know that the herd fed near the fount;
      for Minerva tells Ulysses that he is to go first to Eumæus, whom
      he should find with the swine, near the rock Korax and the fount
      of Arethusa. As the swine then fed at the fountain, so it is
      necessary that a cavern should be found in its vicinity; and this
      seems to coincide, in distance and situation, with that of the
      poem. Near the fount also was the fold or stathmos of Eumæus; for
      the goddess informs Ulysses that he should find his faithful
      servant at or above the fount.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now the hero meets the swineherd close to the fold, which was
      consequently very near that source. At the top of the rock, and
      just above the spot where the waterfall shoots down the
      precipice, is at this day a stagni or pastoral dwelling, which
      the herdsmen of Ithaca still inhabit, on account of the water
      necessary for their cattle. One of these people walked on the
      verge of the precipice at the time of our visit to the place, and
      seemed so anxious to know how we had been conveyed to the spot,
      that his enquiries reminded us of a question probably not
      uncommon in the days of Homer, who more than once represents the
      Ithacences demanding of strangers what ship had brought them to
      the island, it being evident they could not come on foot. He told
      us that there was, on the summit where he stood, a small cistern
      of water, and a kalybea, or shepherd's hut. There are also
      vestiges of ancient habitations, and the place is now called
      Amarâthia. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg302" id=
      "pg302">302</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Convenience, as well as safety, seems to have pointed out the
      lofty situation of Amarathia as a fit place for the residence of
      the herdsmen of this part of the island from the earliest ages. A
      small source of water is a treasure in these climates; and if the
      inhabitants of Ithaca now select a rugged and elevated spot, to
      secure them from the robbers of the Echinades, it is to be
      recollected that the Taphian pirates were not less formidable,
      even in the days of Ulysses, and that a residence in a solitary
      part of the island, far from the fortress, and close to a
      celebrated fountain, must at all times have been dangerous,
      without some such security as the rocks of Korax. Indeed, there
      can be no doubt that the house of Eumæus was on the top of the
      precipice; for Ulysses, in order to evince the truth of his story
      to the swineherd, desires to be thrown from the summit if his
      narration does not prove correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Near the bottom of the precipice is a curious natural gallery,
      about seven feet high, which is expressed in the plate. It may be
      fairly presumed, from the very remarkable coincidence between
      this place and the Homeric account, that this was the scene
      designated by the poet as the fountain of Arethusa, and the
      residence of Eumæus; and, perhaps, it would be impossible to find
      another spot which bears, at this day, so strong a resemblance to
      a poetic description composed at a period so very remote. There
      is no other fountain in this part of the island, nor any rock
      which bears the slightest resemblance to the Korax of Homer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stathmos of the good Eumæus appears to have been little
      different, either in use or construction, from the stagni and
      kalybea of the present day. The poet expressly mentions that
      other herdsmen drove their flocks into the city at
      sunset,&mdash;a custom which still prevails throughout Greece
      during the winter, and that was the season in which Ulysses
      visited Eumæus. Yet Homer accounts for this deviation from the
      prevailing custom, by observing that he had retired from the city
      to avoid the suitors of Penelope. These trifling occurrences
      afford a strong presumption that the Ithaca of Homer was
      something more than the creature of his own fancy, as some have
      supposed it; for though the grand outline of a fable may be
      easily imagined, yet the consistent adaptation of minute
      incidents to a long and elaborate falsehood is a task of the most
      arduous and complicated nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this long extract, by which we have endeavoured to do
      justice to Mr. Gell's argument, we cannot allow room for any
      farther quotations of such extent; and we <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg303" id="pg303">303</a></span> must offer a
      brief and imperfect analysis of the remainder of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third chapter, the traveller arrives at the capital, and
      in the fourth, he describes it in an agreeable manner. We select
      his account of the mode of celebrating a Christian festival in
      the Greek church:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "We were present at the celebration of the feast of the
        Ascension, when the citizens appeared in their gayest dresses,
        and saluted each other in the streets with demonstrations of
        pleasure. As we sate at breakfast in the house of Zignor Zavo,
        we were suddenly roused by the discharge of a gun, succeeded by
        a tremendous crash of pottery, which fell on the tiles, steps,
        and pavements, in every direction. The bells of the numerous
        churches commenced a most discordant jingle; colours were
        hoisted on every mast in the port, and a general shout of joy
        announced some great event. Our host informed us that the feast
        of the Ascension was annually commemorated in this manner at
        Bathi, the populace exclaiming [Greek: anesê o Chrisos,
        alêthinos o Theos,] Christ is risen, the true God."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In another passage, he continues this account as
      follows:&mdash;"In the evening of the festival, the inhabitants
      danced before their houses; and at one we saw the figure which is
      said to have been first used by the youths and virgins of Delos,
      at the happy return of Theseus from the expedition of the Cretan
      Labyrinth. It has now lost much of that intricacy which was
      supposed to allude to the windings of the habitation of the
      Minotaur," &amp;c. &amp;c. This is rather too much for even the
      inflexible gravity of our censorial muscles. When the author
      talks, with all the <i>reality</i> (if we may use the expression)
      of a Lempriere, on the stories of the fabulous ages, we cannot
      refrain from indulging a momentary smile; nor can we seriously
      accompany him in the learned architectural detail by which he
      endeavours to give us, from the Odyssey, the ground-plot of the
      house of Ulysses.&mdash;of which he actually offers a plan in
      drawing! "showing how the description of the house of Ulysses in
      the Odyssey may be supposed to correspond with the foundations
      yet visible on the hill of Aito!"&mdash;Oh, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg304" id="pg304">304</a></span> Foote! Foote!
      why are you lost to such inviting subjects for your ludicrous
      pencil!&mdash;In his account of this celebrated mansion, Mr. Gell
      says, one side of the court seems to have been occupied by the
      Thalamos, or sleeping apartments of the men, &amp;c. &amp;c.;
      and, in confirmation of this hypothesis, he refers to the 10th
      Odyssey, line 340. On examining his reference, we read,
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        [Greek: Es thalamon t ienai, kai sês epibêmenai eunês.]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      where Ulysses records an invitation which he received from Circe
      to take a part of her bed. How this illustrates the above
      conjecture, we are at a loss to divine: but we suppose that some
      numerical error has occurred in the reference, as we have
      detected a trifling mistake or two of the same nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. G. labours hard to identify the cave of Dexia near Bathi (the
      capital of the island), with the grotto of the Nymphs described
      in the 13th Odyssey. We are disposed to grant that he has
      succeeded: but we cannot here enter into the proofs by which he
      supports his opinion; and we can only extract one of the
      concluding sentences of the chapter, which appears to us candid
      and judicious:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Whatever opinion may be formed as to the identity of the cave
        of Dexia with the grotto of the Nymphs, it is fair to state,
        that Strabo positively asserts that no such cave as that
        described by Homer existed in his time, and that geographer
        thought it better to assign a physical change, rather than
        ignorance in Homer, to account for a difference which he
        imagined to exist between the Ithaca of his time and that of
        the poet. But Strabo, who was an uncommonly accurate observer
        with respect to countries surveyed by himself, appears to have
        been wretchedly misled by his informers on many occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
        "That Strabo had never visited this country is evident, not
        only from his inaccurate account of it, but from his citation
        of Appollodorus and Scepsius, whose relations are in direct
        opposition to each other on the subject of Ithaca, as will be
        demonstrated on a future opportunity."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We must, however, observe that "demonstration" is <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg305" id="pg305">305</a></span> a strong
      term.&mdash;In his description of the Leucadian Promontory (of
      which we have a pleasing representation in the plate), the author
      remarks that it is "celebrated for the <i>leap</i> of Sappho, and
      the <i>death</i> of Artemisia." From this variety in the
      expression, a reader would hardly conceive that both the ladies
      perished in the same manner: in fact, the sentence is as proper
      as it would be to talk of the decapitation of Russell, and the
      death of Sidney. The view from this promontory includes the
      island of Corfu; and the name suggests to Mr. Gell the following
      note, which, though rather irrelevant, is of a curious nature,
      and we therefore conclude our citations by transcribing
      it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "It has been generally supposed that Corfu, or Corcyra, was the
        Phæacia of Homer; but Sir Henry Englefield thinks the position
        of that island inconsistent with the voyage of Ulysses as
        described in the Odyssey. That gentleman has also observed a
        number of such remarkable coincidences between the courts of
        Alcinous and Solomon, that they may be thought curious and
        interesting. Homer was familiar with the names of Tyre, Sidon,
        and Egypt; and, as he lived about the time of Solomon, it would
        not have been extraordinary if he had introduced some account
        of the magnificence of that prince into his poem. As Solomon
        was famous for wisdom, so the name of Alcinous signifies
        strength of knowledge; as the gardens of Solomon were
        celebrated, so are those of Alcinous (Od. 7.112.); as the
        kingdom of Solomon was distinguished by twelve tribes under
        twelve princes (1 Kings, ch. 4.), so that of Alcinous (Od. 8.
        390.) was ruled by an equal number; as the throne of Solomon
        was supported by lions of gold (1 Kings, ch. 10.), so that of
        Alcinous was placed on dogs of silver and gold (Od, 7. 91.); as
        the fleets of Solomon were famous, so were those of Alcinous.
        It is perhaps worthy of remark, that Neptune sate on the
        mountains of the SOLYMI, as he returned from Æthiopia to Ægæ,
        while he raised the tempest which threw Ulysses on the coast of
        Phæacia; and that the Solymi of Pamphylia are very considerably
        distant from the route.&mdash;The suspicious character, also,
        which Nausicaa attributes to her countryman agrees precisely
        with that which the Greeks and Romans gave of the Jews."

      The seventh chapter contains a description of the Monastery of
      Kathara, and several adjacent places. The <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg306" id="pg306">306</a></span> eighth, among
      other curiosities, fixes on an imaginary site for the Farm of
      Laertes: but this is the agony of conjecture indeed!&mdash;and
      the ninth chapter mentions another Monastery, and a rock still
      called the School of Homer. Some sepulchral inscriptions of a
      very simple nature are included.&mdash;The tenth and last chapter
      brings us round to the Port of Schoenus, near Bathi; after we
      have completed, seemingly in a very minute and accurate manner,
      the tour of the island.

      We can certainly recommend a perusal of this volume to every
      lover of classical scene and story. If we may indulge the
      pleasing belief that Homer sang of a real kingdom, and that
      Ulysses governed it, though we discern many feeble links in Mr.
      Gell's chain of evidence, we are on the whole induced to fancy
      that this is the Ithaca of the bard and of the monarch. At all
      events, Mr. Gell has enabled every future traveller to form a
      clearer judgment on the question than he could have established
      without such a "Vade-mecum to Ithaca," or a "Have with you, to
      the House of Ulysses," as the present. With Homer in his pocket,
      and Gell on his sumpter-horse or mule, the Odyssean tourist may
      now make a very classical and delightful excursion; and we doubt
      not that the advantages accruing to the Ithacences, from the
      increased number of travellers who will visit them in consequence
      of Mr. Gell's account of their country, will induce them to
      confer on that gentleman any heraldic honours which they may have
      to bestow, should he ever look in upon them again.&mdash;<i>Baron
      Bathi</i> would be a pretty title:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "<i>Hoc</i> Ithacus <i>velit, et magno mercentur
        Atridæ</i>."&mdash;Virgil.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      For ourselves, we confess that all our old Grecian feelings would
      be alive on approaching the fountain of Melainudros, where, as
      the tradition runs, or as the priests relate, Homer was restored
      to sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to the "Grecian Patterson," or "Cary," which Mr. Gell
      has begun to publish; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg307"
      id="pg307">307</a></span> really he has carried the epic rule of
      concealing the person of the author to as great a length as
      either of the above-mentioned heroes of itinerary writ. We hear
      nothing of his "hair-breadth 'scapes" by sea or land; and we do
      not even know, for the greater part of his journey through
      Argolis, whether he relates what he has seen or what he has
      heard. Prom other parts of the book, we find the former to be the
      case: but, though there have been tourists and "strangers" in
      other countries, who have kindly permitted their readers to learn
      rather too much of their sweet selves, yet it is possible to
      carry delicacy, or cautious silence, or whatever it may be
      called, to the contrary extreme. We think that Mr. Gell has
      fallen into this error, so opposite to that of his numerous
      brethren. It is offensive, indeed, to be told what a man has
      eaten for dinner, or how pathetic he was on certain occasions;
      but we like to know that there is a being yet living who
      describes the scenes to which he introduces us; and that it is
      not a mere translation from Strabo or Pausanias which we are
      reading, or a commentary on those authors. This reflection leads
      us to the concluding remark in Mr. Gell's preface (by much the
      most interesting part of his book) to his Itinerary of Greece, in
      which he thus expresses himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The confusion of the modern with the ancient names of places
        in this volume is absolutely unavoidable; they are, however,
        mentioned in such a manner, that the reader will soon be
        accustomed to the indiscriminate use of them. The necessity of
        applying the ancient appellations to the different routes, will
        be evident from the total ignorance of the public on the
        subject of the modern names, which, having never appeared in
        print, are only known to the few individuals who have visited
        the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What could appear less intelligible to the reader, or less
        useful to the traveller, than a route from Chione and Zaracca
        to Kutchukmadi, from thence to Krabata to Schoenochorio, and by
        the mills of Peali, while every one is in some degree
        acquainted with the names of Stymphalus, Nemea, Mycenæ,
        Lyrceia, Lerna, and Tegea?"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg308" id=
    "pg308">308</a></span>
      Although this may be very true inasmuch as it relates to the
      reader, yet to the traveller we must observe, in opposition to
      Mr. Gell, that nothing can be less useful than the designation of
      his route according to the ancient names. We might as well, and
      with as much chance of arriving at the place of our destination,
      talk to a Hounslow post-boy about making haste to <i>Augusta</i>,
      as apply to our Turkish guide in modern Greece for a direction to
      Stymphalus, Nemea, Mycenæ, &amp;c. &amp;c. This is neither more
      nor less than classical affectation; and it renders Mr. Gell's
      book of much more confined use than it would otherwise have
      been:&mdash;but we have some other and more important remarks to
      make on his general directions to Grecian tourists; and we beg
      leave to assure our readers that they are derived from travellers
      who have lately visited Greece. In the first place, Mr. Gell is
      absolutely incautious enough to recommend an interference on the
      part of English travellers with the Minister at the Porte, in
      behalf of the Greeks. "The folly of such neglect (page 16.
      preface,) in many instances, where the emancipation of a district
      might often be obtained by the present of a snuff-box or a watch,
      at Constantinople, <i>and without the smallest danger of exciting
      the jealousy of such a court as that of Turkey,</i> will be
      acknowledged when we are no longer able to rectify the error." We
      have every reason to believe, on the contrary, that the folly of
      half a dozen travellers, taking this advice, might bring us into
      a war. "Never interfere with any thing of the kind," is a much
      sounder and more political suggestion to all English travellers
      in Greece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gell apologises for the introduction of "his panoramic
      designs," as he calls them, on the score of the great difficulty
      of giving any tolerable idea of the face of a country in writing,
      and the ease with which a very accurate knowledge of it may be
      acquired by maps and panoramic designs. We are informed that this
      is not the case with many of these designs. The small scale of
      the single map we have already censured; and we have hinted
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg309" id="pg309">309</a></span>
      that some of the drawings are not remarkable for correct
      resemblance of their originals. The two nearer views of the Gate
      of the Lions at Mycenæ are indeed good likenesses of their
      subject, and the first of them is unusually well executed; but
      the general view of Mycenæ is not more than tolerable in any
      respect; and the prospect of Larissa, &amp;c. is barely equal to
      the former. The view <i>from</i> this last place is also
      indifferent; and we are positively assured that there are no
      windows at Nauplia which look like a box of dominos,&mdash;the
      idea suggested by Mr. Gell's plate. We must not, however, be too
      severe on these picturesque bagatelles, which, probably, were
      very hasty sketches; and the circumstances of weather, &amp;c.
      may have occasioned some difference in the appearance of the same
      objects to different spectators. We shall therefore return to Mr.
      Gell's preface; endeavouring to set him right in his directions
      to travellers, where we think that he is erroneous, and adding
      what appears to have been omitted. In his first sentence, he
      makes an assertion which is by no means correct. He says,
      "<i>We</i> are at present as ignorant of Greece, as of the
      interior of Africa." Surely not quite so ignorant; or several of
      our Grecian <i>Mungo Parks</i> have travelled in vain, and some
      very sumptuous works have been published to no purpose! As we
      proceed, we find the author observing that "Athens is <i>now</i>
      the most polished city of Greece," when we believe it to be the
      most barbarous, even to a proverb&mdash;

      Iannina, the capital of Epirus, and the seat of Ali Pacha's
      government, <i>is</i> in truth deserving of the honours which Mr.
      Gell has improperly bestowed on degraded Athens. As to the
      correctness of the remark concerning the fashion of wearing the
      hair cropped in <i>Molossia,</i> as Mr. Gell informs us, our
      authorities cannot depose: but why will he use the classical term
      of Eleuthero-Lacones, when that people are so much better known
      by their modern name of Mainotes? "The court of the Pacha of
      Tripolizza" is said "to realise the splendid visions of the
      Arabian Nights." This is true with regard to the <i>court</i>:
      but surely the traveller ought to have added that the city and
      palace are most miserable, and form an extraordinary contrast to
      the splendour of the court.&mdash;Mr. Gell mentions <i>gold</i>
      mines in Greece: he should have specified their situation, as it
      certainly is not universally known. When, also, he remarks that
      "the first article of necessity <i>in Greece</i> is a firman, or
      order from the Sultan, permitting the traveller to pass
      unmolested," we are much misinformed if he be right. On the
      contrary, we believe this to be almost the only part of the
      Turkish dominions in which a firman is not necessary; since the
      passport of the Pacha is absolute within his territory (according
      to Mr. G.'s own admission), and much more effectual than a
      firman.&mdash;"Money," he remarks, "is easily procured at
      Salonica, or Patrass, where the English have Consuls." It is much
      better procured, we understand, from the Turkish governors, who
      never charge discount. The Consuls for the English are not of the
      most magnanimous order of Greeks, and far from being so liberal,
      generally speaking; although there are, in course, some
      exceptions, and Strune of Patrass has been more honourably
      mentioned.&mdash;After having observed that "horses seem the best
      mode of conveyance in Greece," Mr. Gell proceeds: "Some
      travellers would prefer an English saddle; but a saddle of this
      sort is always objected to by the owner of the horse, <i>and not
      without reason</i>" &amp;c. This, we <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg311" id="pg311">311</a></span> learn, is far
      from being the case; and, indeed, for a very simple reason, an
      English saddle must seem to be preferable to one of the country,
      because it is much lighter. When, too, Mr. Gell calls the
      <i>postilion</i> "Menzilgi," he mistakes him for his betters:
      <i>Serrugees</i> are postilions; <i>Mensilgis</i> are
      postmasters.&mdash;Our traveller was fortunate in his Turks, who
      are hired to walk by the side of the baggage-horses. They "are
      certain," he says, "of performing their engagement without
      grumbling." We apprehend that this is by no means
      certain:&mdash;but Mr. Gell is perfectly right in preferring a
      Turk to a Greek for this purpose; and in his general
      recommendation to take a Janissary on the tour: who, we may add,
      should be suffered to act as he pleases, since nothing is to be
      done by gentle means, or even by offers of money, at the places
      of accommodation. A courier, to be sent on before to the place at
      which the traveller intends to sleep, is indispensable to
      comfort: but no tourist should be misled by the author's advice
      to suffer the Greeks to gratify their curiosity, in permitting
      them to remain for some time about him on his arrival at an inn.
      They should be removed as soon as possible; for, as to the remark
      that "no stranger would think of intruding when a room is
      pre-occupied," our informants were not so well convinced of that
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we have made the above exceptions to the accuracy of Mr.
      Gell's information, we are most ready to do justice to the
      general utility of his directions, and can certainly concede the
      praise which he is desirous of obtaining,&mdash;namely, "of
      having facilitated the researches of future travellers, by
      affording that local information which it was before impossible
      to obtain." This book, indeed, is absolutely necessary to any
      person who wishes to explore the Morea advantageously; and we
      hope that Mr. Gell will continue his Itinerary over that and over
      every other part of Greece. He allows that his volume "is only
      calculated to become a book of reference, and not of general
      entertainment:" but we <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg312" id=
      "pg312">312</a></span> do not see any reason against the
      compatibility of both objects in a survey of the most celebrated
      country of the ancient world. To that country, we trust, the
      attention not only of our travellers, but of our legislators,
      will hereafter be directed. The greatest caution will, indeed, be
      required, as we have premised, in touching on so delicate a
      subject as the amelioration of the possessions of an ally: but
      the field for the exercise of political sagacity is wide and
      inviting in this portion of the globe; and Mr. Gell, and all
      other writers who interest us, however remotely, in its
      extraordinary <i>capabilities</i>, deserve well of the British
      empire. We shall conclude by an extract from the author's work:
      which, even if it fails of exciting that general interest which
      we hope most earnestly it may attract, towards its important
      subject, cannot, as he justly observes, "be entirely
      uninteresting to the scholar;" since it is a work "which gives
      him a faithful description of the remains of cities, the very
      existence of which was doubtful, as they perished before the æra
      of authentic history." The subjoined quotation is a good specimen
      of the author's minuteness of research as a topographer; and we
      trust that the credit which must accrue to him from the present
      performance will ensure the completion of his Itinerary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The inaccuracies of the maps of Anacharsis are in many
        respects very glaring. The situation of Phlius is marked by
        Strabo as surrounded by the territories of Sicyon, Argos,
        Cleonæ, and Stymphalus. Mr. Hawkins observed, that Phlius, the
        ruins of which still exist near Agios Giorgios, lies in a
        direct line between Cleonæ and Stymphalus, and another from
        Sicyon to Argos; so that Strabo was correct in saying that it
        lay between those four towns; yet we see Phlius, in the map of
        Argolis by M. Barbie du Bocage, placed ten miles to the north
        of Stymphalus, contradicting both history and fact. D'Anville
        is guilty of the same error.
      </p>
      <p>
        "M. du Bocage places a town named Phlius, and by him Phlionte,
        on the point of land which forms the port of Drepano: there are
        not at present any ruins there. The maps of D'Anville are
        generally more correct than any others where <span class=
        "pagenum"><a name="pg313" id="pg313">313</a></span> ancient
        geography is concerned. A mistake occurs on the subject of
        Tiryns, and a place named by him Vathia, but of which nothing
        can be understood. It is possible that Vathi, or the profound
        valley, may be a name sometimes used for the valley of
        Barbitsa, and that the place named by D'Anville Claustra may be
        the outlet of that valley called Kleisoura, which has a
        corresponding signification.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The city of Tiryns is also placed in two different positions,
        once by its Greek name, and again as Tirynthus. The mistake
        between the islands of Sphæria and Calaura has been noticed in
        page 135. The Pontinus, which D'Anville represents as a river,
        and the Erasinus are equally ill placed in his map. There was a
        place called Creopolis, somewhere toward Cynouria; but its
        situation is not easily fixed. The ports called Bucephalium and
        Piræus seem to have been nothing more than little bays in the
        country between Corinth and Epidaurus. The town called Athenæ,
        in Cynouria, by Pausanias, is called Anthena by
        <i>Thucydides</i>, book 5. 41.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In general, the map of D'Anville will be found more accurate
        than those which have been published since his time; indeed the
        mistakes of that geographer are in general such as could not be
        avoided without visiting the country. Two errors of D'Anville
        may be mentioned, lest the opportunity of publishing the
        itinerary of Arcadia should never occur. The first is, that the
        rivers Malætas and Mylaon, near Methydrium, are represented as
        running toward the south, whereas they flow northwards to the
        Ladon; and the second is, that the Aroanius, which falls into
        the Erymanthus at Psophis, is represented as flowing from the
        lake of Pheneos; a mistake which arises from the ignorance of
        the ancients themselves who have written on the subject. The
        fact is that the Ladon receives the waters of the lakes of
        Orchomenos and Pheneos: but the Aroanius rises at a spot not
        two hours distant from Psophis."

    <p>
      In furtherance of our principal object in this critique, we have
      only to add a wish that some of our Grecian tourists, among the
      fresh articles of information concerning Greece which they have
      lately imported, would turn their minds to the language of the
      country. So strikingly similar to the ancient Greek is the modern
      Romaic as a written language, and so dissimilar in sound, that
      even a few general rules concerning pronunciation would be of
      most extensive use. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg314" id=

    <h4>
      DEBATE ON THE FRAME-WORK BILL, IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS, FEBRUARY
      27, 1812.
    </h4>
    <p>
      The order of the day for the second reading of this Bill being
      read,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord BYRON rose, and (for the first time) addressed their
      Lordships as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lords; the subject now submitted to your Lordships for the
      first time, though new to the House, is by no means new to the
      country. I believe it had occupied the serious thoughts of all
      descriptions of persons, long before its introduction to the
      notice of that legislature, whose interference alone could be of
      real service. As a person in some degree connected with the
      suffering county, though a stranger not only to this House in
      general, but to almost every individual whose attention I presume
      to solicit, I must claim some portion of your Lordships'
      indulgence, whilst I offer a few observations on a question in
      which I confess myself deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enter into any detail of the riots would be superfluous: the
      House is already aware that every outrage short of actual
      bloodshed has been perpetrated, and that the proprietors of the
      Frames obnoxious to the rioters, and all persons supposed to be
      connected with them, have been liable to insult and violence.
      During the short time I recently passed in Nottinghamshire, not
      twelve hours elapsed without some fresh act of violence; and on
      the day I left the county I was informed that forty Frames had
      been broken the preceding <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg315"
      id="pg315">315</a></span> evening, as usual, without resistance
      and without detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was then the state of that county, and such I have reason to
      believe it to be at this moment. But whilst these outrages must
      be admitted to exist to an alarming extent, it cannot be denied
      that they have arisen from circumstances of the most unparalleled
      distress: the perseverance of these miserable men in their
      proceedings, tends to prove that nothing but absolute want could
      have driven a large, and once honest and industrious, body of the
      people, into the commission of excesses so hazardous to
      themselves, their families, and the community. At the time to
      which I allude, the town and county were burdened with large
      detachments of the military; the police was in motion, the
      magistrates assembled, yet all the movements, civil and military,
      had led to&mdash;nothing. Not a single instance had occurred of
      the apprehension of any real delinquent actually taken in the
      fact, against whom there existed legal evidence sufficient for
      conviction. But the police, however useless, were by no means
      idle: several notorious delinquents had been detected; men,
      liable to conviction, on the clearest evidence, of the capital
      crime of poverty; men, who had been nefariously guilty of
      lawfully begetting several children, whom, thanks to the times!
      they were unable to maintain. Considerable injury has been done
      to the proprietors of the improved Frames. These machines were to
      them an advantage, inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of
      employing a number of workmen, who were left in consequence to
      starve. By the adoption of one species of Frame in particular,
      one man performed the work of many, and the superfluous labourers
      were thrown out of employment. Yet it is to be observed, that the
      work thus executed was inferior in quality; not marketable at
      home, and merely hurried over with a view to exportation. It was
      called, in the cant of the trade, by the name of "Spider work."
      The rejected workmen, in the blindness of their ignorance,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg316" id="pg316">316</a></span>
      instead of rejoicing at these improvements in arts so beneficial
      to mankind, conceived themselves to be sacrificed to improvements
      in mechanism. In the foolishness of their hearts they imagined,
      that the maintenance and well doing of the industrious poor, were
      objects of greater consequence than the enrichment of a few
      individuals by any improvement, in the implements of trade, which
      threw the workmen out of employment, and rendered the labourer
      unworthy of his hire. And it must be confessed that although the
      adoption of the enlarged machinery in that state of our commerce
      which the country once boasted, might have been beneficial to the
      master without being detrimental to the servant; yet, in the
      present situation of our manufactures, rotting in warehouses,
      without a prospect of exportation, with the demand for work and
      workmen equally diminished, Frames of this description tend
      materially to aggravate the distress and discontent of the
      disappointed sufferers. But the real cause of these distresses
      and consequent disturbances lies deeper. When we are told that
      these men are leagued together not only for the destruction of
      their own comfort, but of their very means of subsistence, can we
      forget that it is the bitter policy, the destructive warfare of
      the last eighteen years, which has destroyed their comfort, your
      comfort, all men's comfort? That policy, which, originating with
      "great statesmen now no more," has survived the dead to become a
      curse on the living, unto the third and fourth generation! These
      men never destroyed their looms till they were become useless,
      worse than useless; till they were become actual impediments to
      their exertions in obtaining their daily bread. Can you, then,
      wonder that in times like these, when bankruptcy, convicted
      fraud, and imputed felony, are found in a station not far beneath
      that of your Lordships, the lowest, though once most useful
      portion of the people, should forget their duty in their
      distresses, and become only less guilty than one of their
      representatives? But while the exalted offender can find means to
      baffle <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg317" id=
      "pg317">317</a></span> the law, new capital punishments must be
      devised, new snares of death must be spread for the wretched
      mechanic, who is famished into guilt. These men were willing to
      dig, but the spade was in other hands: they were not ashamed to
      beg, but there was none to relieve them: their own means of
      subsistence were cut off, all other employments pre-occupied; and
      their excesses, however to be deplored and condemned, can hardly
      be subject of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been stated that the persons in the temporary possession
      of frames connive at their destruction; if this be proved upon
      enquiry, it were necessary that such material accessories to the
      crime should be principles in the punishment. But I did hope,
      that any measure proposed by his Majesty's government, for your
      Lordships' decision, would have had conciliation for its basis;
      or, if that were hopeless, that some previous enquiry, some
      deliberation would have been deemed requisite; not that we should
      have been called at once without examination, and without cause,
      to pass sentences by wholesale, and sign death-warrants
      blindfold. But, admitting that these men had no cause of
      complaint; that the grievances of them and their employers were
      alike groundless; that they deserved the worst; what
      inefficiency, what imbecility has been evinced in the method
      chosen to reduce them! Why were the military called out to be
      made a mockery of, if they were to be called out at all? As far
      as the difference of seasons would permit, they have merely
      parodied the summer campaign of Major Sturgeon; and, indeed, the
      whole proceedings, civil and military, seemed on the model of
      those of the mayor and corporation of Garratt.&mdash;Such
      marchings and counter-marchings! from Nottingham to Bullwell,
      from Bullwell to Banford, from Banford to Mansfield! and when at
      length the detachments arrived at their destination, in all "the
      pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war," they came just in
      time to witness the mischief which had been done, and ascertain
      the escape of the perpetrators, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg318" id="pg318">318</a></span> to collect the "<i>spolia
      opima</i>" in the fragments of broken frames, and return to their
      quarters amidst the derision of old women, and the hootings of
      children. Now, though, in a free country, it were to be wished,
      that our military should never be too formidable, at least to
      ourselves, I cannot see the policy of placing them in situations
      where they can only be made ridiculous. As the sword is the worst
      argument that can be used, so should it be the last. In this
      instance it has been the first; but providentially as yet only in
      the scabbard. The present measure will, indeed, pluck it from the
      sheath; yet had proper meetings been held in the earlier stages
      of these riots, had the grievances of these men and their masters
      (for they also had their grievances) been fairly weighed and
      justly examined, I do think that means might have been devised to
      restore these workmen to their avocations, and tranquillity to
      the county. At present the county suffers from the double
      infliction of an idle military and a starving population. In what
      state of apathy have we been plunged so long, that now for the
      first time the house has been officially apprised of these
      disturbances? All this has been transacting within 130 miles of
      London, and yet we, "good easy men, have deemed full sure our
      greatness was a ripening," and have sat down to enjoy our foreign
      triumphs in the midst of domestic calamity. But all the cities
      you have taken, all the armies which have retreated before your
      leaders, are but paltry subjects of self-congratulation, if your
      land divides against itself, and your dragoons and your
      executioners must be let loose against your
      fellow-citizens.&mdash;You call these men a mob, desperate,
      dangerous, and ignorant; and seem to think that the only way to
      quiet the "<i>Bellua multorum capitum</i>" is to lop off a few of
      its superfluous heads. But even a mob may be better reduced to
      reason by a mixture of conciliation and firmness, than by
      additional irritation and redoubled penalties. Are we aware of
      our obligations to a mob? It is the mob that labour in your
      fields and serve in your <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg319"
      id="pg319">319</a></span> houses,&mdash;that man your navy, and
      recruit your army,&mdash;that have enabled you to defy all the
      world, and can also defy you when neglect and calamity have
      driven them to despair! You may call the people a mob; but do not
      forget, that a mob too often speaks the sentiments of the people.
      And here I must remark, with what alacrity you are accustomed to
      fly to the succour of your distressed allies, leaving the
      distressed of your own country to the care of Providence
      or&mdash;the parish. When the Portuguese suffered under the
      retreat of the French, every arm was stretched out, every hand
      was opened, from the rich man's largess to the widow's mite, all
      was bestowed, to enable them to rebuild their villages and
      replenish their granaries. And at this moment, when thousands of
      misguided but most unfortunate fellow-countrymen are struggling
      with the extremes of hardships and hunger, as your charity began
      abroad it should end at home. A much less sum, a tithe of the
      bounty bestowed on Portugal, even if those men (which I cannot
      admit without enquiry) could not have been restored to their
      employments, would have rendered unnecessary the tender mercies
      of the bayonet and the gibbet. But doubtless our friends have too
      many foreign claims to admit a prospect of domestic relief;
      though never did such objects demand it. I have traversed the
      seat of war in the Peninsula, I have been in some of the most
      oppressed provinces of Turkey, but never under the most despotic
      of infidel governments did I behold such squalid wretchedness as
      I have seen since my return in the very heart of a Christian
      country. And what are your remedies? After months of inaction,
      and months of action worse than inactivity, at length comes forth
      the grand specific, the never-failing nostrum of all state
      physicians, from the days of Draco to the present time. After
      feeling the pulse and shaking the head over the patient,
      prescribing the usual course of warm water and bleeding, the warm
      water of your mawkish police, and the lancets of your military,
      these convulsions must <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg320" id=
      "pg320">320</a></span> terminate in death, the sure consummation
      of the prescriptions of all political Sangrados. Setting aside
      the palpable injustice and the certain inefficiency of the bill,
      are there not capital punishments sufficient in your statutes? Is
      there not blood enough upon your penal code, that more must be
      poured forth to ascend to Heaven and testify against you? How
      will you carry the bill into effect? Can you commit a whole
      county to their own prisons? Will you erect a gibbet in every
      field, and hang up men like scarecrows? or will you proceed (as
      you must to bring this measure into effect) by decimation? place
      the county under martial law? depopulate and lay waste all around
      you? and restore Sherwood Forest as an acceptable gift to the
      crown, in its former condition of a royal chase and an asylum for
      outlaws? Are these the remedies for a starving and desperate
      populace? Will the famished wretch who has braved your bayonets
      be appalled by your gibbets? When death is a relief, and the only
      relief it appears that you will afford him, will he be dragooned
      into tranquillity? Will that which could not be effected by your
      grenadiers, be accomplished by your executioners? If you proceed
      by the forms of law, where is your evidence? Those who have
      refused to impeach their accomplices, when transportation only
      was the punishment, will hardly be tempted to witness against
      them when death is the penalty. With all due deference to the
      noble lords opposite, I think a little investigation, some
      previous enquiry would induce even them to change their purpose.
      That most favourite state measure, so marvellously efficacious in
      many and recent instances, temporising, would not be without its
      advantages in this. When a proposal is made to emancipate or
      relieve, you hesitate, you deliberate for years, you temporise
      and tamper with the minds of men; but a death-bill must be passed
      off hand, without a thought of the consequences. Sure I am, from
      what I have heard, and from what I have seen, that to pass the
      hill under all the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg321" id=
      "pg321">321</a></span> existing circumstances, without enquiry,
      without deliberation, would only be to add injustice to
      irritation, and barbarity to neglect. The framers of such a bill
      must be content to inherit the honours of that Athenian lawgiver
      whose edicts were said to be written not in ink but in blood. But
      suppose it past; suppose one of these men, as I have seen
      them,&mdash;meagre with famine, sullen with despair, careless of
      a life which your Lordships are perhaps about to value at
      something less than the price of a stocking-frame;&mdash;suppose
      this man surrounded by the children for whom he is unable to
      procure bread at the hazard of his existence, about to be torn
      for ever from a family which he lately supported in peaceful
      industry, and which it is not his fault that he can no longer so
      support;&mdash;suppose this man, and there are ten thousand such
      from whom you may select your victims, dragged into court, to be
      tried for this new offence, by this new law; still, there are two
      things wanting to convict and condemn him; and these are, in my
      opinion,&mdash;twelve butchers for a jury, and a Jefferies for a
      judge!

    <h4>
      DEBATE ON THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE'S MOTION FOR A COMMITTEE ON THE
      ROMAN CATHOLIC CLAIMS, APRIL 21. 1812.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Lord BYRON rose and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lords,&mdash;The question before the House has been so
      frequently, fully, and ably discussed, and never perhaps more
      ably than on this night, that it would be difficult to adduce new
      arguments for or against it. But with each discussion,
      difficulties have been removed, objections have been canvassed
      and refuted, and some of the former opponents of Catholic
      emancipation have at length conceded to the expediency of
      relieving the petitioners. In conceding thus much, however, a new
      objection is started; it is not the time, say they, or it is an
      improper <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg322" id=
      "pg322">322</a></span> time, or there is time enough yet. In some
      degree I concur with those who say, it is not the time exactly;
      that time is passed; better had it been for the country, that the
      Catholics possessed at this moment their proportion of our
      privileges, that their nobles held their due weight in our
      councils, than that we should be assembled to discuss their
      claims. It had indeed been better&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p class="i8">
        "Non tempore tali
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cogere concilium cum muros obsidet hostis."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The enemy is without, and distress within. It is too late to
      cavil on doctrinal points, when we must unite in defence of
      things more important than the mere ceremonies of religion. It is
      indeed singular, that we are called together to deliberate, not
      on the God we adore, for in that we are agreed; not about the
      king we obey, for to him we are loyal; but how far a difference
      in the ceremonials of worship, how far believing not too little,
      but too much (the worst that can be imputed to the Catholics),
      how far too much devotion to their God may incapacitate our
      fellow-subjects from effectually serving their king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much has been said, within and without doors, of church and
      state, and although those venerable words have been too often
      prostituted to the most despicable of party purposes, we cannot
      hear them too often; all, I presume, are the advocates of church
      and state,&mdash;the church of Christ, and the state of Great
      Britain; but not a state of exclusion and despotism, not an
      intolerant church, not a church militant, which renders itself
      liable to the very objection urged against the Romish communion,
      and in a greater degree, for the Catholic merely withholds its
      spiritual benediction (and even that is doubtful), but our
      church, or rather our churchmen, not only refuse to the Catholic
      their spiritual grace, but all temporal blessings whatsoever. It
      was an observation of the great Lord Peterborough, made within
      these walls, or within the walls where the Lords then assembled,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg323" id="pg323">323</a></span>
      that he was for a "parliamentary king and a parliamentary
      constitution, but not a parliamentary God and a parliamentary
      religion." The interval of a century has not weakened the force
      of the remark. It is indeed time that we should leave off these
      petty cavils on frivolous points, these Lilliputian sophistries,
      whether our "eggs are best broken at the broad or narrow end."
    </p>
    <p>
      The opponents of the Catholics may be divided into two classes;
      those who assert that the Catholics have too much already, and
      those who allege that the lower orders, at least, have nothing
      more to require. We are told by the former, that the Catholics
      never will be contented: by the latter, that they are already too
      happy. The last paradox is sufficiently refuted by the present as
      by all past petitions; it might as well be said, that the negroes
      did not desire to be emancipated, but this is an unfortunate
      comparison, for you have already delivered them out of the house
      of bondage without any petition on their part, but many from
      their task-masters to a contrary effect; and for myself, when I
      consider this, I pity the Catholic peasantry for not having the
      good fortune to be born black. But the Catholics are contented,
      or at least ought to be, as we are told; I shall, therefore,
      proceed to touch on a few of those circumstances which so
      marvellously contribute to their exceeding contentment. They are
      not allowed the free exercise of their religion in the regular
      army; the Catholic soldier cannot absent himself from the service
      of the Protestant clergyman, and unless he is quartered in
      Ireland, or in Spain, where can he find eligible opportunities of
      attending his own? The permission of Catholic chaplains to the
      Irish militia regiments was conceded as a special favour, and not
      till after years of remonstrance, although an act, passed in
      1793, established it as a right. But are the Catholics properly
      protected in Ireland? Can the church purchase a rood of land
      whereon to erect a chapel? No! all the places of worship are
      built on leases of trust or <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg324"
      id="pg324">324</a></span> sufferance from the laity, easily
      broken, and often betrayed. The moment any irregular wish, any
      casual caprice of the benevolent landlord meets with opposition,
      the doors are barred against the congregation. This has happened
      continually, but in no instance more glaringly, than at the town
      of Newton-Barry, in the county of Wexford. The Catholics enjoying
      no regular chapel, as a temporary expedient, hired two barns;
      which, being thrown into one, served for public worship. At this
      time, there was quartered opposite to the spot an officer whose
      mind appears to have been deeply imbued with those prejudices
      which the Protestant petitions now on the table prove to have
      been fortunately eradicated from the more rational portion of the
      people; and when the Catholics were assembled on the Sabbath as
      usual, in peace and good-will towards men, for the worship of
      their God and yours, they found the chapel door closed, and were
      told that if they did not immediately retire (and they were told
      this by a yeoman officer and a magistrate), the riot act should
      be read, and the assembly dispersed at the point of the bayonet!
      This was complained of to the middle man of government, the
      secretary at the castle in 1806, and the answer was (in lieu of
      redress), that he would cause a letter to be written to the
      colonel, to prevent, if possible, the recurrence of similar
      disturbances. Upon this fact, no very great stress need be laid;
      but it tends to prove that while the Catholic church has not
      power to purchase land for its chapels to stand upon, the laws
      for its protection are of no avail. In the mean time, the
      Catholics are at the mercy of every "pelting petty officer," who
      may choose to play his "fantastic tricks before high heaven," to
      insult his God, and injure his fellow-creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every school-boy, any foot-boy (such have held commissions in our
      service), any foot-boy who can exchange his shoulder-knot for an
      epaulette, may perform all this and more against the Catholic by
      virtue of that <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg325" id=
      "pg325">325</a></span> very authority delegated to him by his
      sovereign, for the express purpose of defending his fellow
      subjects to the last drop of his blood, without discrimination or
      distinction between Catholic and Protestant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have the Irish Catholics the full benefit of trial by jury? They
      have not; they never can have until they are permitted to share
      the privilege of serving as sheriffs and under-sheriffs. Of this
      a striking example occurred at the last Enniskillen assizes. A
      yeoman was arraigned for the murder of a Catholic named
      Macvournagh: three respectable, uncontradicted witnesses deposed
      that they saw the prisoner load, take aim, fire at, and kill the
      said Macvournagh. This was properly commented on by the judge:
      but to the astonishment of the bar, and indignation of the court,
      the Protestant jury acquitted the accused. So glaring was the
      partiality, that Mr. Justice Osborne felt it his duty to bind
      over the acquitted, but not absolved assassin, in large
      recognizances; thus for a time taking away his license to kill
      Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are the very laws passed in their favour observed? They are
      rendered nugatory in trivial as in serious cases. By a late act,
      Catholic chaplains are permitted in gaols, but in Fermanagh
      county the grand jury lately persisted in presenting a suspended
      clergyman for the office, thereby evading the statute,
      notwithstanding the most pressing remonstrances of a most
      respectable magistrate, named Fletcher, to the contrary. Such is
      law, such is justice, for the happy, free, contented Catholic!
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been asked, in another place, Why do not the rich
      Catholics endow foundations for the education of the priesthood?
      Why do you not permit them to do so? Why are all such bequests
      subject to the interference, the vexatious, arbitrary, peculating
      interference of the Orange commissioners for charitable
      donations?
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Maynooth college, in no instance, except at the time of its
      foundation, when a noble Lord (Camden), at the head of the Irish
      administration, did appear to interest <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg326" id="pg326">326</a></span> himself in
      its advancement; and during the government of a noble Duke
      (Bedford), who, like his ancestors, has ever been the friend of
      freedom and mankind, and who has not so far adopted the selfish
      policy of the day as to exclude the Catholics from the number of
      his fellow-creatures; with these exceptions, in no instance has
      that institution been properly encouraged. There was indeed a
      time when the Catholic clergy were conciliated, while the Union
      was pending, that Union which could not be carried without them,
      while their assistance was requisite in procuring addresses from
      the Catholic counties; then they were cajoled and caressed,
      feared and flattered, and given to understand that "the Union
      would do every thing;" but the moment it was passed, they were
      driven back with contempt into their former obscurity.

      In the conduct pursued towards Maynooth college, every thing is
      done to irritate and perplex&mdash;every thing is done to efface
      the slightest impression of gratitude from the Catholic mind; the
      very hay made upon the lawn, the fat and tallow of the beef and
      mutton allowed, must be paid for and accounted upon oath. It is
      true, this economy in miniature cannot sufficiently be commended,
      particularly at a time when only the insect defaulters of the
      Treasury, your Hunts and your Chinnerys, when only those "gilded
      bugs" can escape the microscopic eye of ministers. But when you
      come forward, session after session, as your paltry pittance is
      wrung from you with wrangling and reluctance, to boast of your
      liberality, well might the Catholic exclaim, in the words of
      Prior:&mdash;

      Some persons have compared the Catholics to the beggar in Gil
      Bias: who made them beggars? Who <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg327" id="pg327">327</a></span> are enriched with the spoils of
      their ancestors? And cannot you relieve the beggar when your
      fathers have made him such? If you are disposed to relieve him at
      all, cannot you do it without flinging your farthings in his
      face? As a contrast, however, to this beggarly benevolence, let
      us look at the Protestant Charter Schools; to them you have
      lately granted 41,000<i>l</i>.: thus are they supported, and how
      are they recruited? Montesquieu observes on the English
      constitution, that the model may be found in Tacitus, where the
      historian describes the policy of the Germans, and adds, "This
      beautiful system was taken from the woods;" so in speaking of the
      charter schools, it may be observed, that this beautiful system
      was taken from the gipsies. These schools are recruited in the
      same manner as the Janissaries at the time of their enrolment
      under Amurath, and the gipsies of the present day with stolen
      children, with children decoyed and kidnapped from their Catholic
      connections by their rich and powerful Protestant neighbours:
      this is notorious, and one instance may suffice to show in what
      manner:&mdash;The sister of a Mr. Carthy (a Catholic gentleman of
      very considerable property) died, leaving two girls, who were
      immediately marked out as proselytes, and conveyed to the charter
      school of Coolgreny; their uncle, on being apprised of the fact,
      which took place during his absence, applied for the restitution
      of his nieces, offering to settle an independence on these his
      relations; his request was refused, and not till after five
      years' struggle, and the interference of very high authority,
      could this Catholic gentleman obtain back his nearest of kindred
      from a charity charter school. In this manner are proselytes
      obtained, and mingled with the offspring of such Protestants as
      may avail themselves of the institution. And how are they taught?
      A catechism is put into their hands, consisting of, I believe,
      forty-five pages, in which are three questions relative to the
      Protestant religion; one of these queries is, "Where was the
      Protestant religion before Luther?" <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg328" id="pg328">328</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer, "In the Gospel." The remaining forty-four pages and a
      half regard the damnable idolatry of Papists!
    </p>
    <p>
      Allow me to ask our spiritual pastors and masters, is this
      training up a child in the way which he should go? Is this the
      religion of the Gospel before the time of Luther? that religion
      which preaches "Peace on earth, and glory to God?" Is it bringing
      up infants to be men or devils? Better would it be to send them
      any where than teach them such doctrines; better send them to
      those islands in the South Seas, where they might more humanely
      learn to become cannibals; it would be less disgusting that they
      were brought up to devour the dead, than persecute the living.
      Schools do you call them? call them rather dunghills, where the
      viper of intolerance deposits her young, that when their teeth
      are cut and their poison is mature, they may issue forth, filthy
      and venomous, to sting the Catholic. But are these the doctrines
      of the Church of England, or of churchmen? No, the most
      enlightened churchmen are of a different opinion. What says
      Paley? "I perceive no reason why men of different religious
      persuasions should not sit upon the same bench, deliberate in the
      same council, or fight in the same ranks, as well as men of
      various religious opinions, upon any controverted topic of
      natural history, philosophy, or ethics." It may be answered, that
      Paley was not strictly orthodox; I know nothing of his orthodoxy,
      but who will deny that he was an ornament to the church, to human
      nature, to Christianity?
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not dwell upon the grievance of tithes, so severely felt
      by the peasantry, but it may be proper to observe, that there is
      an addition to the burden, a per centage to the gatherer, whose
      interest it thus becomes to rate them as highly as possible, and
      we know that in many large livings in Ireland the only resident
      Protestants are the tithe proctor and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst many causes of irritation, too numerous for <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg329" id="pg329">329</a></span>
      recapitulation, there is one in the militia not to be passed
      over,&mdash;I mean the existence of Orange lodges amongst the
      privates. Can the officers deny this? And if such lodges do
      exist, do they, can they, tend to promote harmony amongst the
      men, who are thus individually separated in society, although
      mingled in the ranks? And is this general system of persecution
      to be permitted; or is it to be believed that with such a system
      the Catholics can or ought to be contented? If they are, they
      belie human nature; they are then, indeed, unworthy to be any
      thing but the slaves you have made them. The facts stated are
      from most respectable authority, or I should not have dared in
      this place, or any place, to hazard this avowal. If exaggerated,
      there are plenty as willing, as I believe them to be unable, to
      disprove them. Should it be objected that I never was in Ireland,
      I beg leave to observe, that it is as easy to know something of
      Ireland without having been there, as it appears with some to
      have been born, bred, and cherished there, and yet remain
      ignorant of its best interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are who assert that the Catholics have already been too
      much indulged. See (cry they) what has been done: we have given
      them one entire college, we allow them food and raiment, the full
      enjoyment of the elements, and leave to fight for us as long as
      they have limbs and lives to offer, and yet they are never to be
      satisfied!&mdash;Generous and just declaimers! To this, and to
      this only, amount the whole of your arguments, when stript of
      their sophistry. Those personages remind me of a story of a
      certain drummer, who, being called upon in the course of duty to
      administer punishment to a friend tied to the halberts, was
      requested to flog high, he did&mdash;to flog low, he did&mdash;to
      flog in the middle, he did,&mdash;high, low, down the middle, and
      up again, but all in vain; the patient continued his complaints
      with the most provoking pertinacity, until the drummer, exhausted
      and angry, flung down his scourge, exclaiming, "The devil burn
      you, there's no pleasing you, flog where <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg330" id="pg330">330</a></span> one will!"
      Thus it is, you have flogged the Catholic high, low, here, there,
      and every where, and then you wonder he is not pleased. It is
      true that time, experience, and that weariness which attends even
      the exercise of barbarity, have taught you to flog a little more
      gently; but still you continue to lay on the lash, and will so
      continue, till perhaps the rod may be wrested from your hands,
      and applied to the backs of yourselves and your posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said by somebody in a former debate, (I forget by whom,
      and am not very anxious to remember,) if the Catholics are
      emancipated, why not the Jews? If this sentiment was dictated by
      compassion for the Jews, it might deserve attention, but as a
      sneer against the Catholic, what is it but the language of
      Shylock transferred from his daughter's marriage to Catholic
      emancipation&mdash;

    <p>
      I presume a Catholic is a Christian, even in the opinion of him

      It is a remark often quoted of Dr. Johnson, (whom I take to be
      almost as good authority as the gentle apostle of intolerance,
      Dr. Duigenan,) that he who could entertain serious apprehensions
      of danger to the church in these times, would have "cried fire in
      the deluge." This is more than a metaphor; for a remnant of these
      antediluvians appear actually to have come down to us, with fire
      in their mouths and water in their brains, to disturb and perplex
      mankind with their whimsical outcries. And as it is an infallible
      symptom of that distressing malady with which I conceive them to
      be afflicted (so any doctor will inform your Lordships), for the
      unhappy invalids to perceive a flame perpetually flashing before
      their eyes, particularly when their eyes are shut (as those of
      the persons to whom I allude have long been), it is impossible to
      convince these poor creatures, that the fire against which they
      are perpetually warning us and themselves <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg331" id="pg331">331</a></span> is nothing
      but an <i>ignis fatuus</i> of their own drivelling imaginations.

      These are your true Protestants. Like Bayle, who protested
      against all sects whatsoever, so do they protest against Catholic
      petitions, Protestant petitions, all redress, all that reason,
      humanity, policy, justice, and common sense, can urge against the
      delusions of their absurd delirium. These are the persons who
      reverse the fable of the mountain that brought forth a mouse;
      they are the mice who conceive themselves in labour with
      mountains.

      To return to the Catholics; suppose the Irish were actually
      contented under their disabilities; suppose them capable of such
      a bull as not to desire deliverance, ought we not to wish it for
      ourselves? Have we nothing to gain by their emancipation? What
      resources have been wasted? What talents have been lost by the
      selfish system of exclusion? You already know the value of Irish
      aid; at this moment the defence of England is intrusted to the
      Irish militia; at this moment, while the starving people are
      rising in the fierceness of despair, the Irish are faithful to
      their trust. But till equal energy is imparted throughout by the
      extension of freedom, you cannot enjoy the full benefit of the
      strength which you are glad to interpose between you and
      destruction. Ireland has done much, but will do more. At this
      moment the only triumph obtained through long years of
      continental disaster has been achieved by an Irish general: it is
      true he is not a Catholic; had he been so, we should have been
      deprived of his exertions: but I presume no one will assert that
      his religion would have impaired his talents or diminished his
      patriotism; though, in that case, he must have conquered in the
      ranks, for he never could have commanded an army. <span class=

      But he is fighting the battles of the Catholics abroad; his noble
      brother has this night advocated their cause, with an eloquence
      which I shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my
      panegyric; whilst a third of his kindred, as unlike as unequal,
      has been combating against his Catholic brethren in Dublin, with
      circular letters, edicts, proclamations, arrests, and
      dispersions;&mdash;all the vexatious implements of petty warfare
      that could be wielded by the mercenary guerillas of government,
      clad in the rusty armour of their obsolete statutes. Your
      Lordships will, doubtless, divide new honours between the Saviour
      of Portugal, and the Dispenser of Delegates. It is singular,
      indeed, to observe the difference between our foreign and
      domestic policy; if Catholic Spain, faithful Portugal, or the no
      less Catholic and faithful king of the one Sicily, (of which, by
      the by, you have lately deprived him,) stand in need of succour,
      away goes a fleet and an army, an ambassador and a subsidy,
      sometimes to fight pretty hardly, generally to negotiate very
      badly, and always to pay very dearly for our Popish allies. But
      let four millions of fellow-subjects pray for relief, who fight
      and pay and labour in your behalf, they must be treated as
      aliens; and although their "father's house has many mansions,"
      there is no resting-place for them. Allow me to ask, are you not
      fighting for the emancipation of Ferdinand VII., who certainly is
      a fool, and, consequently, in all probability a bigot? and have
      you more regard for a foreign sovereign than your own
      fellow-subjects, who are not fools, for they know your interest
      better than you know your own; who are not bigots, for they
      return you good for evil; but who are in worse durance than the
      prison of a usurper, inasmuch as the fetters of the mind are more
      galling than those of the body?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the consequences of your not acceding to the claims of the
      petitioners, I shall not expatiate; you know them, you will feel
      them, and your children's children when you are passed away.
      Adieu to that Union so <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg333" id=
      "pg333">333</a></span> called, as "<i>Lucus a non lucendo</i>," a
      Union from never uniting, which in its first operation gave a
      death-blow to the independence of Ireland, and in its last may be
      the cause of her eternal separation from this country. If it must
      be called a Union, it is the union of the shark with his prey;
      the spoiler swallows up his victim, and thus they become one and
      indivisible. Thus has Great Britain swallowed up the parliament,
      the constitution, the independence of Ireland, and refuses to
      disgorge even a single privilege, although for the relief of her
      swollen and distempered body politic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, my Lords, before I sit down, will his Majesty's
      ministers permit me to say a few words, not on their merits, for
      that would be superfluous, but on the degree of estimation in
      which they are held by the people of these realms? The esteem in
      which they are held has been boasted of in a triumphant tone on a
      late occasion within these walls, and a comparison instituted
      between their conduct and that of noble lords on this side of the
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      What portion of popularity may have fallen to the share of my
      noble friends (if such I may presume to call them), I shall not
      pretend to ascertain; but that of his Majesty's ministers it were
      vain to deny. It is, to be sure, a little like the wind, "no one
      knows whence it cometh or whither it goeth," but they feel it,
      they enjoy it, they boast of it. Indeed, modest and
      unostentatious as they are, to what part of the kingdom, even the
      most remote, can they flee to avoid the triumph which pursues
      them? If they plunge into the midland counties, there will they
      be greeted by the manufacturers, with spurned petitions in their
      hands, and those halters round their necks recently voted in
      their behalf, imploring blessings on the heads of those who so
      simply, yet ingeniously, contrived to remove them from their
      miseries in this to a better world. If they journey on to
      Scotland, from Glasgow to Johnny Groats, every where will they
      receive similar marks of approbation. If <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg334" id="pg334">334</a></span> they take a
      trip from Portpatrick to Donaghadee, there will they rush at once
      into the embraces of four Catholic millions, to whom their vote
      of this night is about to endear them for ever. When they return
      to the metropolis, if they can pass under Temple Bar without
      unpleasant sensations at the sight of the greedy niches over that
      ominous gateway, they cannot escape the acclamations of the
      livery, and the more tremulous, but not less sincere, applause,
      the blessings, "not loud but deep," of bankrupt merchants and
      doubting stock-holders. If they look to the army, what wreaths,
      not of laurel, but of nightshade, are preparing for the heroes of
      Walcheren. It is true, there are few living deponents left to
      testify to their merits on that occasion; but a "cloud of
      witnesses" are gone above from that gallant army which they so
      generously and piously despatched, to recruit the "noble army of
      martyrs."
    </p>
    <p>
      What if in the course of this triumphal career (in which they
      will gather as many pebbles as Caligula's army did on a similar
      triumph, the prototype of their own,) they do not perceive any of
      those memorials which a grateful people erect in honour of their
      benefactors; what although not even a sign-post will condescend
      to depose the Saracen's head in favour of the likeness of the
      conquerors of Walcheren, they will not want a picture who can
      always have a caricature; or regret the omission of a statue who
      will so often see themselves exalted in effigy. But their
      popularity is not limited to the narrow bounds of an island;
      there are other countries where their measures, and above all,
      their conduct to the Catholics, must render them preeminently
      popular. If they are beloved here, in France they must be adored.
      There is no measure more repugnant to the designs and feelings of
      Bonaparte than Catholic emancipation; no line of conduct more
      propitious to his projects, than that which has been pursued, is
      pursuing, and, I fear, will be pursued, towards Ireland. What is
      England without Ireland, and what is <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg335" id="pg335">335</a></span> Ireland
      without the Catholics? It is on the basis of your tyranny
      Napoleon hopes to build his own. So grateful must oppression of
      the Catholics be to his mind, that doubtless (as he has lately
      permitted some renewal of intercourse) the next cartel will
      convey to this country cargoes of seve-china and blue ribands,
      (things in great request, and of equal value at this moment,)
      blue ribands of the Legion of Honour for Dr. Duigenan and his
      ministerial disciples. Such is that well-earned popularity, the
      result of those extraordinary expeditions, so expensive to
      ourselves, and so useless to our allies; of those singular
      enquiries, so exculpatory to the accused and so dissatisfactory
      to the people; of those paradoxical victories, so honourable, as
      we are told, to the British name, and so destructive to the best
      interests of the British nation: above all, such is the reward of
      a conduct pursued by ministers towards the Catholics.

    <p>
      I have to apologise to the House, who will, I trust, pardon one,
      not often in the habit of intruding upon their indulgence, for so

      opinion is, as my vote will be, in favour of the motion.

    <hr />
    <h4>
      DEBATE ON MAJOR CARTWRIGHT'S PETITION, JUNE 1. 1813.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Lord BYRON rose and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lords,&mdash;The petition which I now hold for the purpose of
      presenting to the House, is one which I humbly conceive requires
      the particular attention of your Lordships, inasmuch as, though
      signed but by a single individual, it contains statements which
      (if not disproved) demand most serious investigation. The
      grievance of which the petitioner complains is neither selfish
      nor imaginary. It is not his own only, for it has been, and is
      still felt by numbers. No one without these walls, nor indeed
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg336" id="pg336">336</a></span>
      within, but may to-morrow be made liable to the same insult and
      obstruction, in the discharge of an imperious duty for the
      restoration of the true constitution of these realms, by
      petitioning for reform in parliament. The petitioner, my Lords,
      is a man whose long life has been spent in one unceasing struggle
      for the liberty of the subject, against that undue influence
      which has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished;
      and whatever difference of opinion may exist as to his political
      tenets, few will be found to question the integrity of his
      intentions. Even now oppressed with years, and not exempt from
      the infirmities attendant on his age, but still unimpaired in
      talent, and unshaken in spirit&mdash;"<i>frangas non
      fleetes</i>"&mdash;he has received many a wound in the combat
      against corruption; and the new grievance, the fresh insult of
      which he complains, may inflict another scar, but no dishonour.
      The petition is signed by John Cartwright, and it was in behalf
      of the people and parliament, in the lawful pursuit of that
      reform in the representation, which is the best service to be
      rendered both to parliament and people, that he encountered the
      wanton outrage which forms the subject-matter of his petition to
      your Lordships. It is couched in firm, yet respectful
      language&mdash;in the language of a man, not regardless of what
      is due to himself, but at the same time, I trust, equally mindful
      of the deference to be paid to this House. The petitioner states,
      amongst other matter of equal, if not greater importance, to all
      who are British in their feelings, as well as blood and birth,
      that on the 21st January, 1813, at Huddersfield, himself and six
      other persons, who, on hearing of his arrival, had waited on him
      merely as a testimony of respect, were seized by a military and
      civil force, and kept in close custody for several hours,
      subjected to gross and abusive insinuation from the commanding
      officer, relative to the character of the petitioner; that he
      (the petitioner) was finally carried before a magistrate, and not
      released till an examination of his papers proved that
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg337" id="pg337">337</a></span>
      there was not only no just, but not even statutable charge
      against him; and that, notwithstanding the promise and order from
      the presiding magistrates of a copy of the warrant against your
      petitioner, it was afterwards withheld on divers pretexts, and
      has never until this hour been granted. The names and condition
      of the parties will be found in the petition. To the other topics
      touched upon in the petition, I shall not now advert, from a wish
      not to encroach upon the time of the House; but I do most
      sincerely call the attention of your Lordships to its general
      contents&mdash;it is in the cause of the parliament and people
      that the rights of this venerable freeman have been violated, and
      it is, in my opinion, the highest mark of respect that could be
      paid to the House, that to your justice, rather than by appeal to
      any inferior court, he now commits, himself. Whatever may be the
      fate of his remonstrance, it is some satisfaction to me, though
      mixed with regret for the occasion, that I have this opportunity
      of publicly stating the obstruction to which the subject is
      liable, in the prosecution of the most lawful and imperious of
      his duties, the obtaining by petition reform in parliament. I
      have shortly stated his complaint; the petitioner has more fully
      expressed it. Your Lordships will, I hope, adopt some measure
      fully to protect and redress him, and not him alone, but the
      whole body of the people, insulted and aggrieved in his person,
      by the interposition of an abused civil, and unlawful military
      force between them and their right of petition to their own
      representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Lordship then presented the petition from Major Cartwright,
      which was read, complaining of the circumstances at Huddersfield,
      and of interruptions given to the right of petitioning in several
      places in the northern parts of the kingdom, and which his
      Lordship moved should be laid on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several lords having spoken on the question,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Byron replied, that he had, from motives of duty, presented
      this petition to their Lordships' consideration. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg338" id="pg338">338</a></span> The noble
      Earl had contended, that it was not a petition, but a speech; and
      that, as it contained no prayer, it should not be received. What
      was the necessity of a prayer? If that word were to be used in
      its proper sense, their Lordships could not expect that any man
      should pray to others. He had only to say, that the petition,
      though in some parts expressed strongly perhaps, did not contain
      any improper mode of address, but was couched in respectful
      language towards their Lordships; he should therefore trust their
      Lordships would allow the petition to be received. <span class=

      <p>
        [Footnote 1: During a week of rain at Diodati, in the summer of
        1816, the party having amused themselves with reading German
        ghost stories, they agreed at last to write something in
        imitation of them. "You and I," said Lord Byron to Mrs.
        Shelley, "will publish ours together." He then began his tale
        of the Vampire; and, having the whole arranged in his head,
        repeated to them a sketch of the story one evening;&mdash;but,
        from the narrative being in prose, made but little progress in
        filling up his outline. The most memorable result, indeed, of
        their storytelling compact, was Mrs. Shelley's wild and
        powerful romance of Frankenstein.&mdash;MOORE.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I began it," says Lord Byron, "in an old account book of Miss
        Milbanke's, which I kept because it contains the word
        'Household,' written by her twice on the inside blank page of
        the covers; being the only two scraps I have in the world in
        her writing, except her name to the Deed of Separation."]
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="quotdate">
      <i>June</i> 17. 1816.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 17&mdash;, having for some time determined on a
      journey through countries not hitherto much frequented by
      travellers, I set out, accompanied by a friend, whom I shall
      designate by the name of Augustus Darvell. He was a few years my
      elder, and a man of considerable fortune and ancient family;
      advantages which an extensive capacity prevented him alike from
      undervaluing or overrating. Some peculiar circumstances in his
      private history had rendered him to me an object of attention, of
      interest, and even of regard, which neither the reserve of his
      manners, nor occasional indications of an inquietude at times
      nearly approaching to alienation of mind, could extinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was yet young in life, which I had begun early; but my intimacy
      with him was of a recent date: we had been educated at the same
      schools and university; but his progress through these had
      preceded mine, and he had been deeply initiated, into what is
      called the world, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg340" id=
      "pg340">340</a></span> while I was yet in my noviciate. While
      thus engaged, I heard much both of his past and present life;
      and, although in these accounts there were many and
      irreconcileable contradictions, I could still gather from the
      whole that he was a being of no common order, and one who,
      whatever pains he might take to avoid remark, would still be
      remarkable. I had cultivated his acquaintance subsequently, and
      endeavoured to obtain his friendship, but this last appeared to
      be unattainable; whatever affections he might have possessed,
      seemed now, some to have been extinguished, and others to be
      concentred: that his feelings were acute, I had sufficient
      opportunities of observing; for, although he could control, he
      could not altogether disguise them: still he had a power of
      giving to one passion the appearance of another, in such a manner
      that it was difficult to define the nature of what was working
      within him; and the expressions of his features would vary so
      rapidly, though slightly, that it was useless to trace them to
      their sources. It was evident that he was a prey to some cureless
      disquiet; but whether it arose from ambition, love, remorse,
      grief, from one or all of these, or merely from a morbid
      temperament akin to disease, I could not discover: there were
      circumstances alleged, which might have justified the application
      to each of these causes; but, as I have before said, these were
      so contradictory and contradicted, that none could be fixed upon
      with accuracy. Where there is mystery, it is generally supposed
      that there must also be evil: I know not how this may be, but in
      him there certainly was the one, though I could not ascertain the
      extent of the other&mdash;and felt loth, as far as regarded
      himself, to believe in its existence. My advances were received
      with sufficient coldness; but I was young, and not easily
      discouraged, and at length succeeded in obtaining, to a certain
      degree, that common-place intercourse and moderate confidence of
      common and every-day concerns, created and cemented by similarity
      of pursuit and frequency of meeting, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg341" id="pg341">341</a></span> which is
      called intimacy, or friendship, according to the ideas of him who
      uses those words to express them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darvell had already travelled extensively; and to him I had
      applied for information with regard to the conduct of my intended
      journey. It was my secret wish that he might be prevailed on to
      accompany me; it was also a probable hope, founded upon the
      shadowy restlessness which I observed in him, and to which the
      animation which he appeared to feel on such subjects, and his
      apparent indifference to all by which he was more immediately
      surrounded, gave fresh strength. This wish I first hinted, and
      then expressed: his answer, though I had partly expected it, gave
      me all the pleasure of surprise&mdash;he consented; and, after
      the requisite arrangement, we commenced our voyages. After
      journeying through various countries of the south of Europe, our
      attention was turned towards the East, according to our original
      destination; and it was in my progress through those regions that
      the incident occurred upon which will turn what I may have to
      relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constitution of Darvell, which must from his appearance have
      been in early life more than usually robust, had been for some
      time gradually giving way, without the intervention of any
      apparent disease: he had neither cough nor hectic, yet he became
      daily more enfeebled: his habits were temperate, and he neither
      declined nor complained of fatigue; yet he was evidently wasting
      away: he became more and more silent and sleepless, and at length
      so seriously altered, that my alarm grew proportionate to what I
      conceived to be his danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had determined, on our arrival at Smyrna, on an excursion to
      the ruins of Ephesus and Sardis, from which I endeavoured to
      dissuade him in his present state of indisposition&mdash;but in
      vain: there appeared to be an oppression on his mind, and a
      solemnity in his manner, which ill corresponded with his
      eagerness to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg342" id=
      "pg342">342</a></span> proceed on what I regarded as a mere party
      of pleasure, little suited to a valetudinarian; but I opposed him
      no longer&mdash;and in a few days we set off together,
      accompanied only by a serrugee and a single janizary.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had passed halfway towards the remains of Ephesus, leaving
      behind us the more fertile environs of Smyrna, and were entering
      upon that wild and tenantless track through the marshes and
      defiles which lead to the few huts yet lingering over the broken
      columns of Diana&mdash;the roofless walls of expelled
      Christianity, and the still more recent but complete desolation
      of abandoned mosques&mdash;when the sudden and rapid illness of
      my companion obliged us to halt at a Turkish cemetery, the
      turbaned tombstones of which were the sole indication that human
      life had ever been a sojourner in this wilderness. The only
      caravansera we had seen was left some hours behind us, not a
      vestige of a town or even cottage was within sight or hope, and
      this "city of the dead" appeared to be the sole refuge for my
      unfortunate friend, who seemed on the verge of becoming the last
      of its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation, I looked round for a place where he might most
      conveniently repose:&mdash;contrary to the usual aspect of
      Mahometan burial-grounds, the cypresses were in this few in
      number, and these thinly scattered over its extent: the
      tombstones were mostly fallen, and worn with age:&mdash;upon one
      of the most considerable of these, and beneath one of the most
      spreading trees, Darvell supported himself, in a half-reclining
      posture, with great difficulty. He asked for water. I had some
      doubts of our being able to find any, and prepared to go in
      search of it with hesitating despondency: but he desired me to
      remain; and turning to Suleiman, our janizary, who stood by us
      smoking with great tranquillity, he said, "Suleiman, verbana su,"
      (<i>i.e.</i> bring some water,) and went on describing the spot
      where it was to be found with great minuteness, at a small well
      for camels, a few hundred yards to the right: the janizary
      obeyed. I <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg343" id=
      "pg343">343</a></span> said to Darvell, "How did you know
      this?"&mdash;He replied, "From our situation; you must perceive
      that this place was once inhabited, and could not have been so
      without springs: I have also been here before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been here before!&mdash;How came you never to mention
      this to me? and what could you be doing in a place where no one
      would remain a moment longer than they could help it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To this question I received no answer. In the mean time Suleiman
      returned with the water, leaving the serrugee and the horses at
      the fountain. The quenching of his thirst had the appearance of
      reviving him for a moment; and I conceived hopes of his being
      able to proceed, or at least to return, and I urged the attempt.
      He was silent&mdash;and appeared to be collecting his spirits for
      an effort to speak. He began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the end of my journey, and of my life;&mdash;I came here
      to die: but I have a request to make, a command&mdash;for such my
      last words must be.&mdash;You will observe it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly; but have better hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no hopes, nor wishes, but this&mdash;conceal my death
      from every human being."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope there will be no occasion; that you will recover,
      and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace!&mdash;it must be so: promise this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swear it, by all that"&mdash;&mdash;He here dictated an oath of
      great solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no occasion for this&mdash;I will observe your request;
      and to doubt me is&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be helped,&mdash;you must swear."
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the oath: it appeared to relieve him. He removed a seal
      ring from his finger, on which were some Arabic characters, and
      presented it to me. He proceeded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the ninth day of the month, at noon precisely (what month you
      please, but this must be the day), you <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg344" id="pg344">344</a></span> must fling
      this ring into the salt springs which run into the Bay of
      Eleusis: the day after, at the same hour, you must repair to the
      ruins of the temple of Ceres, and wait one hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ninth day of the month, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ninth."
    </p>
    <p>
      As I observed that the present was the ninth day of the month;
      his countenance changed, and he paused. As he sat, evidently
      becoming more feeble, a stork, with a snake in her beak, perched
      upon a tombstone near us; and, without devouring her prey,
      appeared to be steadfastly regarding us. I know not what impelled
      me to drive it away, but the attempt was useless; she made a few
      circles in the air, and returned exactly to the same spot.
      Darvell pointed to it, and smiled: he spoke&mdash;I know not
      whether to himself or to me&mdash;but the words were only, "'Tis
      well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is well? what do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter: you must bury me here this evening, and exactly where
      that bird is now perched. You know the rest of my injunctions."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded to give me several directions as to the manner
      in which his death might be best concealed. After these were
      finished, he exclaimed, "You perceive that bird?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the serpent writhing in her beak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless: there is nothing uncommon in it; it is her natural
      prey. But it is odd that she does not devour it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled in a ghastly manner, and said, faintly, "It is not yet
      time!" As he spoke, the stork flew away. My eyes followed it for
      a moment&mdash;it could hardly be longer than ten might be
      counted. I felt Darvell's weight, as it were, increase upon my
      shoulder, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg345" id=
      "pg345">345</a></span> and, turning to look upon his face,
      perceived that he was dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shocked with the sudden certainty which could not be
      mistaken&mdash;his countenance in a few minutes became nearly
      black. I should have attributed so rapid a change to poison, had
      I not been aware that he had no opportunity of receiving it
      unperceived. The day was declining, the body was rapidly
      altering, and nothing remained but to fulfil his request. With
      the aid of Suleiman's ataghan and my own sabre, we scooped a
      shallow grave upon the spot which Darvell had indicated: the
      earth easily gave way, having already received some Mahometan
      tenant. We dug as deeply as the time permitted us, and throwing
      the dry earth upon all that remained of the singular being so
      lately departed, we cut a few sods of greener turf from the less
      withered soil around us, and laid them upon his sepulchre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between astonishment and grief, I was tearless.

      Ravenna, February 7. 1821.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      In the different pamphlets which you have had the goodness to
      send me, on the Pope and Bowles' controversy, I perceive that my
      name is occasionally introduced by both parties. Mr. Bowles
      refers more than once to what he is pleased to consider "a
      remarkable circumstance," not only in his letter to Mr. Campbell,
      but in his reply to the Quarterly. The Quarterly also and Mr.
      Gilchrist have conferred on me the dangerous honour of a
      quotation; and Mr. Bowles indirectly makes a kind of appeal to me
      personally, by saying, "Lord Byron, <i>if he remembers</i> the
      circumstance, will <i>witness</i>"&mdash;<i>(witness</i> IN
      ITALICS, an ominous character for a testimony at present).
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not avail myself of a "non mi ricordo," even after so
      long a residence in Italy;&mdash;I <i>do</i> "remember the
      circumstance,"&mdash;and have no reluctance to relate it (since
      called upon so to do), as correctly as the distance of time and
      the impression of intervening events will permit me. In the year
      1812, more than three <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg347" id=
      "pg347">347</a></span> years after the publication of "English
      Bards and Scotch Reviewers," I had the honour of meeting Mr.
      Bowles in the house of our venerable host of "Human Life,"
      &amp;c. the last Argonaut of classic English poetry, and the
      Nestor of our inferior race of living poets. Mr. Bowles calls
      this "soon after" the publication; but to me three years appear a
      considerable segment of the immortality of a modern poem. I
      recollect nothing of "the rest of the company going into another
      room,"&mdash;nor, though I well remember the topography of our
      host's elegant and classically furnished mansion, could I swear
      to the very room where the conversation occurred, though the
      "taking <i>down</i> the poem" seems to fix it in the library. Had
      it been "taken <i>up</i>" it would probably have been in the
      drawing-room. I presume also that the "remarkable circumstance"
      took place <i>after</i> dinner; as I conceive that neither Mr.
      Bowles's politeness nor appetite would have allowed him to detain
      "the rest of the company" standing round their chairs in the
      "other room," while we were discussing "the Woods of Madeira,"
      instead of circulating its vintage. Of Mr. Bowles's "good humour"
      I have a full and not ungrateful recollection; as also of his
      gentlemanly manners and agreeable conversation. I speak of the
      <i>whole</i>, and not of particulars; for whether he did or did
      not use the precise words printed in the pamphlet, I cannot say,
      nor could he with accuracy. Of "the tone of seriousness" I
      certainly recollect nothing: on the contrary, I thought Mr.
      Bowles rather disposed to treat the subject lightly: for he said
      (I have no objection to be contradicted if incorrect), that some
      of his good-natured friends had come to him and exclaimed, "Eh!
      Bowles! how came you to make the Woods of Madeira?" &amp;c.
      &amp;c. and that he had been at some pains and pulling down of
      the poem to convince them that he had never made "the Woods" do
      any thing of the kind. He was right, and <i>I was wrong,</i> and
      have been wrong still up to this acknowledgment; for I ought to
      have looked twice before I wrote <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg348" id="pg348">348</a></span> that which involved an
      inaccuracy capable of giving pain. The fact was, that, although I
      had certainly before read "the Spirit of Discovery," I took the
      quotation from the review. But the mistake was mine, and not the
      <i>review's,</i> which quoted the passage correctly enough, I
      believe. I blundered&mdash;God knows how&mdash;into attributing
      the tremors of the lovers to "the Woods of Madeira," by which
      they were surrounded. And I hereby do fully and freely declare
      and asseverate, that the Woods did <i>not</i> tremble to a kiss,
      and that the lovers did. I quote from memory&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"A kiss
      </p>
      <p>
        Stole on the listening silence, &amp;c. &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        They [the lovers] trembled, even as if the power," &amp;c.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      And if I had been aware that this declaration would have been in
      the smallest degree satisfactory to Mr. Bowles, I should not have
      waited nine years to make it, notwithstanding that "English Bards
      and Scotch Reviewers" had been suppressed some time previously to
      my meeting him at Mr. Rogers's. Our worthy host might indeed have
      told him as much, as it was at his representation that I
      suppressed it. A new edition of that lampoon was preparing for
      the press, when Mr. Rogers represented to me, that "I was
      <i>now</i> acquainted with many of the persons mentioned in it,
      and with some on terms of intimacy;" and that he knew "one family
      in particular to whom its suppression would give pleasure." I did
      not hesitate one moment, it was cancelled instantly; and it is no
      fault of mine that it has ever been republished. When I left
      England, in April, 1816, with no very violent intentions of
      troubling that country again, and amidst scenes of various kinds
      to distract my attention,&mdash;almost my last act, I believe,
      was to sign a power of attorney, to yourself, to prevent or
      suppress any attempts (of which several had been made in Ireland)
      at a republication. It is proper that I should state, that the
      persons with whom I was subsequently <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg349" id="pg349">349</a></span> acquainted,
      whose names had occurred in that publication, were made my
      acquaintances at their own desire, or through the unsought
      intervention of others. I never, to the best of my knowledge,
      sought a personal introduction to any. Some of them to this day I
      know only by correspondence; and with one of those it was begun
      by myself, in consequence, however, of a polite verbal
      communication from a third person.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have dwelt for an instant on these circumstances, because it
      has sometimes been made a subject of bitter reproach to me to
      have endeavoured to <i>suppress</i> that satire. I never shrunk,
      as those who know me know, from any personal consequences which
      could be attached to its publication. Of its subsequent
      suppression, as I possessed the copyright, I was the best judge
      and the sole master. The circumstances which occasioned the
      suppression I have now stated; of the motives, each must judge
      according to his candour or malignity. Mr. Bowles does me the
      honour to talk of "noble mind," and "generous magnanimity;" and
      all this because "the circumstance would have been explained had
      not the book been suppressed." I see no "nobility of mind" in an
      act of simple justice; and I hate the word "<i>magnanimity,"</i>
      because I have sometimes seen it applied to the grossest of
      impostors by the greatest of fools; but I would have "explained
      the circumstance," notwithstanding "the suppression of the book,"
      if Mr. Bowles had expressed any desire that I should. As the
      "gallant Galbraith" says to "Baillie Jarvie," "Well, the devil
      take the mistake, and all that occasioned it." I have had as
      great and greater mistakes made about me personally and
      poetically, once a month for these last ten years, and never
      cared very much about correcting one or the other, at least after
      the first eight and forty hours had gone over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must now, however, say a word or two about Pope, of whom you
      have my opinion more at large in the unpublished letter <i>on</i>
      or <i>to</i> (for I forget which) the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg350" id="pg350">350</a></span> editor of
      "Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine;"&mdash;and here I doubt that Mr.
      Bowles will not approve of my sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I regret having published "English Bards and Scotch
      Reviewers," the part which I regret the least is that which
      regards Mr. Bowles with reference to Pope. Whilst I was writing
      that publication, in 1807 and 1808, Mr. Hobhouse was desirous
      that I should express our mutual opinion of Pope, and of Mr.
      Bowles's edition of his works. As I had completed my outline, and
      felt lazy, I requested that <i>he</i> would do so. He did it. His
      fourteen lines on Bowles's Pope are in the first edition of
      "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers;" and are quite as severe and
      much more poetical than my own in the second. On reprinting the
      work, as I put my name to it, I omitted Mr. Hobhouse's lines, and
      replaced them with my own, by which the work gained less than Mr.
      Bowles. I have stated this in the preface to the second edition.
      It is many years since I have read that poem; but the Quarterly
      Review, Mr. Octavius Gilchrist, and Mr. Bowles himself, have been
      so obliging as to refresh my memory, and that of the public. I am
      grieved to say, that in reading over those lines, I repent of
      their having so far fallen short of what I meant to express upon
      the subject of Bowles's edition of Pope's Works. Mr. Bowles says,
      that "Lord Byron <i>knows</i> he does <i>not</i> deserve this
      character." I know no such thing. I have met Mr. Bowles
      occasionally, in the best society in London; he appeared to me an
      amiable, well-informed, and extremely able man. I desire nothing
      better than to dine in company with such a mannered man every day
      in the week: but of "his character" I know nothing personally; I
      can only speak to his manners, and these have my warmest
      approbation. But I never judge from manners, for I once had my
      pocket picked by the civilest gentleman I ever met with; and one
      of the mildest persons I ever saw was All Pacha. Of Mr. Bowles's
      "<i>character</i>" I will <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg351"
      id="pg351">351</a></span> not do him the <i>injustice</i> to
      judge from the edition of Pope, if he prepared it heedlessly; nor
      the <i>justice,</i> should it be otherwise, because I would
      neither become a literary executioner nor a personal one. Mr.
      Bowles the individual, and Mr. Bowles the editor, appear the two
      most opposite things imaginable.
    </p>

      I won't say "vile," because it is harsh; nor "mistaken," because
      it has two syllables too many: but every one must fill up the
      blank as he pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I saw of Mr. Bowles increased my surprise and regret that he
      should ever have lent his talents to such a task. If he had been
      a fool, there would have been some excuse for him; if he had been
      a needy or a bad man, his conduct would have been intelligible:
      but he is the opposite of all these; and thinking and feeling as
      I do of Pope, to me the whole thing is unaccountable. However, I
      must call things by their right names. I cannot call his edition
      of Pope a "candid" work; and I still think that there is an
      affectation of that quality not only in those volumes, but in the
      pamphlets lately published.

        "Why <i>yet</i> he doth <i>deny</i> his prisoners."

    <p>
      Mr. Bowles says, that "he has seen passages in his letters to
      Martha Blount which were never published by me, and I <i>hope
      never will</i> be by others; which are so <i>gross</i> as to
      imply the <i>grossest</i> licentiousness." Is this fair play? It
      may, or it may not be that such passages exist; and that Pope,
      who was not a monk, although a Catholic, may have occasionally
      sinned in word and deed with woman in his youth: but is this a
      sufficient ground for such a sweeping denunciation? Where is the
      unmarried Englishman of a certain rank of life, who (provided he
      has not taken orders) has not to reproach himself between the
      ages of sixteen and thirty with far more licentiousness than has
      ever yet been traced to Pope? Pope lived in the public eye from
      his youth <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg352" id=
      "pg352">352</a></span> upwards; he had all the dunces of his own
      time for his enemies, and, I am sorry to say, some, who have not
      the apology of dulness for detraction, since his death; and yet
      to what do all their accumulated hints and charges
      amount?&mdash;to an equivocal <i>liaison</i> with Martha Blount,
      which might arise as much from his infirmities as from his
      passions; to a hopeless flirtation with Lady Mary W. Montagu; to
      a story of Cibber's; and to two or three coarse passages in his
      works. <i>Who</i> could come forth clearer from an invidious
      inquest on a life of fifty-six years? Why are we to be
      officiously reminded of such passages in his letters, provided
      that they exist. Is Mr. Bowles aware to what such rummaging among
      "letters" and "stories" might lead? I have myself seen a
      collection of letters of another eminent, nay, pre-eminent,
      deceased poet, so abominably gross, and elaborately coarse, that
      I do not believe that they could be paralleled in our language.
      What is more strange, is, that some of these are couched as
      <i>postscripts</i> to his serious and sentimental letters, to
      which are tacked either a piece of prose, or some verses, of the
      most hyperbolical indecency. He himself says, that if "obscenity
      (using a much coarser word) be the sin against the Holy Ghost, he
      most certainly cannot be saved." These letters are in existence,
      and have been seen by many besides myself; but would his
      <i>editor</i> have been "<i>candid</i>" in even alluding to them?
      Nothing would have even provoked <i>me</i>, an indifferent
      spectator, to allude to them, but this further attempt at the
      depreciation of Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should we say to an editor of Addison, who cited the
      following passage from Walpole's letters to George Montagu? "Dr.
      Young has published a new book, &amp;c. Mr. Addison sent for the
      young Earl of Warwick, as he was dying, to show him in what peace
      a Christian could die; unluckily he died of <i>brandy:</i>
      nothing makes a Christian die in peace like being maudlin! but
      don't say this in Gath where you are." Suppose the editor
      introduced it with this preface: "One <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg353" id="pg353">353</a></span> circumstance
      is mentioned by Horace Walpole, which, if true, was indeed
      <i>flagitious</i>. Walpole informs Montagu that Addison sent for
      the young Earl of Warwick, when dying, to show him in what peace
      a Christian could die; but unluckily he died drunk," &amp;c.
      &amp;c. Now, although there might occur on the subsequent, or on
      the same page, a faint show of disbelief, seasoned with the
      expression of "the <i>same candour</i>" (the <i>same</i> exactly
      as throughout the book), I should say that this editor was either
      foolish or false to his trust; such a story ought not to have
      been admitted, except for one brief mark of crushing indignation,
      unless it were <i>completely proved.</i> Why the words "<i>if
      true</i>?" that "<i>if"</i> is not a peacemaker. Why talk of
      "Cibber's testimony" to his licentiousness? to what does this
      amount? that Pope when very young was <i>once</i> decoyed by some
      noblemen and the player to a house of carnal recreation. Mr.
      Bowles was not always a clergyman; and when he was a very young
      man, was he never seduced into as much? If I were in the humour
      for story-telling, and relating little anecdotes, I could tell a
      much better story of Mr. Bowles than Cibber's, upon much better
      authority, viz. that of Mr. Bowles himself. It was not related by
      <i>him</i> in my presence, but in that of a third person, whom
      Mr. Bowles names oftener than once in the course of his replies.
      This gentleman related it to me as a humorous and witty anecdote;
      and so it was, whatever its other characteristics might be. But
      should I, for a youthful frolic, brand Mr. Bowles with a
      "libertine sort of love," or with "licentiousness?" is he the
      less now a pious or a good man, for not having always been a
      priest? No such thing; I am willing to believe him a good man,
      almost as good a man as Pope, but no better.

      The truth is, that in these days the grand "<i>primum mobile"</i>
      of England is <i>cant;</i> cant political, cant poetical, cant
      religious, cant moral; but always cant, multiplied through all
      the varieties of life. It is the fashion, and while it lasts will
      be too powerful for those who can <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg354" id="pg354">354</a></span> only exist by taking the tone
      of the time. I say <i>cant,</i> because it is a thing of words,
      without the smallest influence upon human actions; the English
      being no wiser, no better, and much poorer, and more divided
      amongst themselves, as well as far less moral, than they were
      before the prevalence of this verbal decorum. This hysterical
      horror of poor Pope's not very well ascertained, and never fully
      proved amours (for even Cibber owns that he prevented the
      somewhat perilous adventure in which Pope was embarking) sounds
      very virtuous in a controversial pamphlet; but all men of the
      world who know what life is, or at least what it was to them in
      their youth, must laugh at such a ludicrous foundation of the
      charge of "a libertine sort of love;" while the more serious will
      look upon those who bring forward such charges upon an insulated
      fact as fanatics or hypocrites, perhaps both. The two are
      sometimes compounded in a happy mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Octavius Gilchrist speaks rather irreverently of a "second
      tumbler of <i>hot</i> white-wine negus." What does he mean? Is
      there any harm in negus? or is it the worse for being <i>hot</i>?
      or does Mr. Bowles drink negus? I had a better opinion of him. I
      hoped that whatever wine he drank was neat; or, at least, that,
      like the ordinary in Jonathan Wild, "he preferred <i>punch,</i>
      the rather as there was nothing against it in Scripture." I
      should be sorry to believe that Mr. Bowles was fond of negus; it
      is such a "candid" liquor, so like a wishy-washy compromise
      between the passion for wine and the propriety of water. But
      different writers have divers tastes. Judge Blackstone composed
      his "Commentaries" (he was a poet too in his youth) with a bottle
      of port before him. Addison's conversation was not good for much
      till he had taken a similar dose. Perhaps the prescription of
      these two great men was not inferior to the very different one of
      a soi-disant poet of this day, who, after wandering amongst the
      hills, returns, goes to bed, and dictates his verses, being fed
      by <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg355" id=
      "pg355">355</a></span> a by-stander with bread and butter during
      the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now come to Mr. Bowles's "invariable principles of poetry."
      These Mr. Bowles and some of his correspondents pronounce
      "unanswerable;" and they are "unanswered," at least by Campbell,
      who seems to have been astounded by the title. The sultan of the
      time being offered to ally himself to a king of France because
      "he hated the word league;" which proves that the Padishan
      understood French. Mr. Campbell has no need of my alliance, nor
      shall I presume to offer it; but I do hate that word
      "<i>invariable</i>." What is there of <i>human</i>, be it poetry,
      philosophy, wit, wisdom, science, power, glory, mind, matter,
      life, or death, which is "<i>invariable</i>?" Of course I put
      things divine out of the question. Of all arrogant baptisms of a
      book, this title to a pamphlet appears the most complacently
      conceited. It is Mr. Campbell's part to answer the contents of
      this performance, and especially to vindicate his own "Ship,"
      which Mr. Bowles most triumphantly proclaims to have struck to
      his very first fire.
    </p>

      It is no affair of mine, but having once begun, (certainly not by
      my own wish, but called upon by the frequent recurrence to my
      name in the pamphlets,) I am like an Irishman in a "row," "any
      body's customer." I shall therefore say a word or two on the
      "Ship."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles asserts that Campbell's "Ship of the Line" derives all
      its poetry, not from "<i>art</i>," but from "<i>nature</i>."
      "Take away the waves, the winds, the sun, &amp;c. &amp;c.
      <i>one</i> will become a stripe of blue bunting; and the other a
      piece of coarse canvass on three tall poles." Very true; take
      away the "waves," "the winds," and there will be no ship at all,
      not only for poetical, but for any other purpose; and take away
      "the sun," and we must <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg356" id=
      "pg356">356</a></span> read Mr. Bowles's pamphlet by
      candle-light. But the "poetry" of the "Ship" does <i>not</i>
      depend on "the waves," &amp;c.; on the contrary, the "Ship of the
      Line" confers its own poetry upon the waters, and heightens
      <i>theirs.</i> I do not deny, that the "waves and winds," and
      above all "the sun," are highly poetical; we know it to our cost,
      by the many descriptions of them in verse: but if the waves bore
      only the foam upon their bosoms, if the winds wafted only the
      sea-weed to the shore, if the sun shone neither upon pyramids,
      nor fleets, nor fortresses, would its beams be equally poetical?
      I think not: the poetry is at least reciprocal. Take away "the
      Ship of the line" "swinging round" the "calm water," and the calm
      water becomes a somewhat monotonous thing to look at,
      particularly if not transparently <i>clear</i>; witness the
      thousands who pass by without looking on it at all. What was it
      attracted the thousands to the launch? they might have seen the
      poetical "calm water" at Wapping, or in the "London Dock," or in
      the Paddington Canal, or in a horse-pond, or in a slop-basin, or
      in any other vase. They might have heard the poetical winds
      howling through the chinks of a pigsty, or the garret window;
      they might have seen the sun shining on a footman's livery, or on
      a brass warming pan; but could the "calm water," or the "wind,"
      or the "sun," make all, or any of these "poetical?" I think not.
      Mr. Bowles admits "the Ship" to be poetical, but only from those
      accessaries: now if they <i>confer</i> poetry so as to make one
      thing poetical, they would make other things poetical; the more
      so, as Mr. Bowles calls a "ship of the line" without
      them,&mdash;that is to say, its "masts and sails and
      streamers,"&mdash;"blue bunting," and "coarse canvass," and "tall
      poles." So they are; and porcelain is clay, and man is dust, and
      flesh is grass, and yet the two latter at least are the subjects
      of much poesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Mr. Bowles ever gaze upon the sea? I presume that he has, at
      least upon a sea-piece. Did any painter ever paint the sea
      <i>only</i>, without the addition of a ship, boat, wreck, or some
      such adjunct? Is the sea <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg357"
      id="pg357">357</a></span> itself a more attractive, a more moral,
      a more poetical object, with or without a vessel, breaking its
      vast but fatiguing monotony? Is a storm more poetical without a
      ship? or, in the poem of the Shipwreck, is it the storm or the
      ship which most interests? both <i>much</i> undoubtedly; but
      without the vessel, what should we care for the tempest? It would
      sink into mere descriptive poetry, which in itself was never
      esteemed a high order of that art.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look upon myself as entitled to talk of naval matters, at least
      to poets:&mdash;with the exception of Walter Scott, Moore, and
      Southey, perhaps, who have been voyagers, I have <i>swam</i> more
      miles than all the rest of them together now living ever
      <i>sailed</i>, and have lived for months and months on shipboard;
      and, during the whole period of my life abroad, have scarcely
      ever passed a month out of sight of the ocean: besides being
      brought up from two years till ten on the brink of it. I
      recollect, when anchored off Cape Sigeum in 1810, in an English
      frigate, a violent squall coming on at sunset, so violent as to
      make us imagine that the ship would part cable, or drive from her
      anchorage. Mr. Hobhouse and myself, and some officers, had been
      up the Dardanelles to Abydos, and were just returned in time. The
      aspect of a storm in the Archipelago is as poetical as need be,
      the sea being particularly short, dashing, and dangerous, and the
      navigation intricate and broken by the isles and currents. Cape
      Sigeum, the tumuli of the Troad, Lemnos, Tenedos, all added to
      the associations of the time. But what seemed the most
      "<i>poetical</i>" of all at the moment, were the numbers (about
      two hundred) of Greek and Turkish craft, which were obliged to
      "cut and run" before the wind, from their unsafe anchorage, some
      for Tenedos, some for other isles, some for the main, and some it
      might be for eternity. The sight of these little scudding
      vessels, darting over the foam in the twilight, now appearing and
      now disappearing between the waves in the cloud of night, with
      their peculiarly <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg358" id=

      being of "<i>coarse canvass</i>," but of white cotton,) skimming
      along as quickly, but less safely than the sea-mews which hovered
      over them; their evident distress, their reduction to fluttering
      specks in the distance, their crowded succession, their
      <i>littleness</i>, as contending with the giant element, which
      made our stout forty-four's <i>teak</i> timbers (she was built in
      India) creak again; their aspect and their motion, all struck me
      as something far more "poetical" than the mere broad, brawling,
      shipless sea, and the sullen winds, could possibly have been
      without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Euxine is a noble sea to look upon, and the port of
      Constantinople the most beautiful of harbours, and yet I cannot
      but think that the twenty sail of the line, some of one hundred
      and forty guns, rendered it more "poetical" by day in the sun,
      and by night perhaps still more, for the Turks illuminate their
      vessels of war in a manner the most picturesque, and yet all this
      is <i>artificial</i>. As for the Euxine, I stood upon the
      Symplegades&mdash;I stood by the broken altar still exposed to
      the winds upon one of them&mdash;I felt all the "<i>poetry</i>"
      of the situation, as I repeated the first lines of Medea; but
      would not that "poetry" have been heightened by the <i>Argo</i>?
      It was so even by the appearance of any merchant vessel arriving
      from Odessa. But Mr. Bowles says, "Why bring your ship off the
      stocks?" for no reason that I know, except that ships are built
      to be launched. The water, &amp;c. undoubtedly HEIGHTENS the
      poetical associations, but it does not <i>make</i> them; and the
      ship amply repays the obligation: they aid each other; the water
      is more poetical with the ship&mdash;the ship less so without the
      water. But even a ship laid up in dock, is a grand and a poetical
      sight. Even an old boat, keel upwards, wrecked upon the barren
      sand, is a "poetical" object, (and Wordsworth, who made a poem
      about a washing tub and a blind boy, may tell you so as well as
      I,) whilst a long extent of sand and unbroken water, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg359" id="pg359">359</a></span> without the
      boat, would be as like dull prose as any pamphlet lately
      published.

      What makes the poetry in the image of the "<i>marble waste of
      Tadmor</i>," or Grainger's "Ode to Solitude," so much admired by
      Johnson? Is it the "<i>marble</i>" or the "<i>waste,</i>" the
      <i>artificial</i> or the <i>natural</i> object? The "waste" is
      like all other <i>wastes</i>; but the "<i>marble</i>" of Palmyra
      makes the poetry of the passage as of the place.

    <p>
      The beautiful but barren Hymettus, the whole coast of Attica, her
      hills and mountains, Pentelicus, Anchesmus, Philopappus, &amp;c.
      &amp;c. are in themselves poetical, and would be so if the name
      of Athens, of Athenians, and her very ruins, were swept from the
      earth. But am I to be told that the "nature" of Attica would be
      <i>more</i> poetical without the "art" of the Acropolis? of the
      Temple of Theseus? and of the still all Greek and glorious
      monuments of her exquisitely artificial genius? Ask the traveller
      what strikes him as most poetical, the Parthenon, or the rock on
      which it stands? The COLUMNS of Cape Colonna, or the Cape itself?
      The rocks at the foot of it, or the recollection that Falconer's
      <i>ship</i> was bulged upon them? There are a thousand rocks and
      capes far more picturesque than those of the Acropolis and Cape
      Sunium in themselves; what are they to a thousand scenes in the
      wilder parts of Greece, of Asia Minor, Switzerland, or even of
      Cintra in Portugal, or to many scenes of Italy, and the Sierras
      of Spain? But it is the "<i>art</i>," the columns, the temples,
      the wrecked vessel, which give them their antique and their
      modern poetry, and not the spots themselves. Without them, the
      <i>spots</i> of earth would be unnoticed and unknown; buried,
      like Babylon and Nineveh, in indistinct confusion, without
      poetry, as without existence; but to whatever spot of earth these
      ruins were transported, if they were <i>capable</i> of
      transportation, like the obelisk, and the sphinx, and the
      Memnon's head, <i>there</i> they would still exist in the
      perfection of their beauty, and in the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg360" id="pg360">360</a></span> pride of
      their poetry. I opposed, and will ever oppose, the robbery of
      ruins from Athens, to instruct the English in sculpture; but why
      did I do so? The <i>ruins</i> are as poetical in Piccadilly as
      they were in the Parthenon; but the Parthenon and its rock are
      less so without them. Such is the poetry of art.

      Mr. Bowles contends again that the pyramids of Egypt are
      poetical, because of "the association with boundless deserts,"
      and that a "pyramid of the same dimensions" would not be sublime
      in "Lincoln's Inn Fields:" not <i>so</i> poetical certainly; but
      take away the "pyramids," and what is the "<i>desert?"</i> Take
      away Stone-henge from Salisbury plain, and it is nothing more
      than Hounslow heath, or any other unenclosed down. It appears to
      me that St. Peter's, the Coliseum, the Pantheon, the Palatine,
      the Apollo, the Laocoon, the Venus di Medicis, the Hercules, the
      dying Gladiator, the Moses of Michael Angelo, and all the higher
      works of Canova, (I have already spoken of those of ancient
      Greece, still extant in that country, or transported to England,)
      are as <i>poetical</i> as Mont Blanc or Mount Ætna, perhaps still
      more so, as they are direct manifestations of mind, and
      <i>presuppose</i> poetry in their very conception; and have,
      moreover, as being such, a something of actual life, which cannot
      belong to any part of inanimate nature, unless we adopt the
      system of Spinosa, that the world is the Deity. There can be
      nothing more poetical in its aspect than the city of Venice: does
      this depend upon the sea, or the canals?&mdash;

      Is it the canal which runs between the palace and the prison, or
      the "Bridge of Sighs," which connects them, that render it
      poetical? Is it the "Canal Grande," or the Rialto which arches
      it, the churches which tower over it, the palaces which line, and
      the gondolas which glide over the waters, that render this city
      more poetical than Rome itself? Mr. Bowles will say, perhaps,
      that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg361" id=
      "pg361">361</a></span> Rialto is but marble, the palaces and
      churches only stone, and the gondolas a "coarse" black cloth,
      thrown over some planks of carved wood, with a shining bit of
      fantastically formed iron at the prow, "<i>without</i>" the
      water. And I tell him that without these, the water would be
      nothing but a clay-coloured ditch; and whoever says the contrary,
      deserves to be at the bottom of that, where Pope's heroes are
      embraced by the mud nymphs. There would be nothing to make the
      canal of Venice more poetical than that of Paddington, were it
      not for the artificial adjuncts above mentioned; although it is a
      perfectly natural canal, formed by the sea, and the innumerable
      islands which constitute the site of this extraordinary city.

      The very Cloaca of Tarquin at Rome are as poetical as Richmond
      Hill; many will think more so: take away Rome, and leave the
      Tibur and the seven hills, in the nature of Evander's time. Let
      Mr. Bowles, or Mr. Wordsworth, or Mr. Southey, or any of the
      other "naturals," make a poem upon them, and then see which is
      most poetical, their production, or the commonest guide-book,
      which tells you the road from St. Peter's to the Coliseum, and
      informs you what you will see by the way. The ground interests in
      Virgil, because it <i>will</i> be <i>Rome</i>, and not because it
      is Evander's rural domain.

      Mr. Bowles then proceeds to press Homer into his service, in
      answer to a remark of Mr. Campbell's, that "Homer was a great
      describer of works of art." Mr. Bowles contends, that all his
      great power, even in this, depends upon their connection with
      nature. The "shield of Achilles derives its poetical interest
      from the subjects described on it." And from what does the
      <i>spear</i> of Achilles derive its interest? and the helmet and
      the mail worn by Patroclus, and the celestial armour, and the
      very brazen greaves of the well-booted Greeks? Is it solely from
      the legs, and the back, and the breast, and the human body, which
      they enclose? In that case, it would have been more poetical to
      have made them fight <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg362" id=
      "pg362">362</a></span> naked; and Gulley and Gregson, as being
      nearer to a state of nature, are more poetical boxing in a pair
      of drawers than Hector and Achilles in radiant armour, and with
      heroic weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the clash of helmets, and the rushing of chariots, and
      the whizzing of spears, and the glancing of swords, and the
      cleaving of shields, and the piercing of breast-plates, why not
      represent the Greeks and Trojans like two savage tribes, tugging
      and tearing, and kicking and biting, and gnashing, foaming,
      grinning, and gouging, in all the poetry of martial nature,
      unencumbered with gross, prosaic, artificial arms; an equal
      superfluity to the natural warrior, and his natural poet. Is
      there any thing unpoetical in Ulysses striking the horses of
      Rhesus with <i>his bow</i> (having forgotten his thong), or would
      Mr. Bowles have had him kick them with his foot, or smack them
      with his hand, as being more unsophisticated?
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gray's Elegy, is there an image more striking than his
      "shapeless sculpture?" Of sculpture in general, it may be
      observed, that it is more poetical than nature itself, inasmuch
      as it represents and bodies forth that ideal beauty and sublimity
      which is never to be found in actual nature. This at least is the
      general opinion. But, always excepting the Venus di Medicis, I
      differ from that opinion, at least as far as regards female
      beauty; for the head of Lady Charlemont (when I first saw her
      nine years ago) seemed to possess all that sculpture could
      require for its ideal. I recollect seeing something of the same
      kind in the head of an Albanian girl, who was actually employed
      in mending a road in the mountains, and in some Greek, and one or
      two Italian, faces. But of <i>sublimity</i>, I have never seen
      any thing in human nature at all to approach the expression of
      sculpture, either in the Apollo, the Moses, or other of the
      sterner works of ancient or modern art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us examine a little further this "babble of green fields" and
      of bare nature in general as superior <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg363" id="pg363">363</a></span> to artificial
      imagery, for the poetical purposes of the fine arts. In landscape
      painting, the great artist does not give you a literal copy of a
      country, but he invents and composes one. Nature, in her actual
      aspect, does not furnish him with such existing scenes as he
      requires. Even where he presents you with some famous city, or
      celebrated scene from mountain or other nature, it must be taken
      from some particular point of view, and with such light, and
      shade, and distance, &amp;c. as serve not only to heighten its
      beauties, but to shadow its deformities. The poetry of nature
      alone, <i>exactly</i> as she appears, is not sufficient to bear
      him out. The very sky of his painting is not the <i>portrait</i>
      of the sky of nature; it is a composition of different
      <i>skies</i>, observed at different times, and not the whole
      copied from any <i>particular</i> day. And why? Because nature is
      not lavish of her beauties; they are widely scattered, and
      occasionally displayed, to be selected with care, and gathered
      with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of sculpture I have just spoken. It is the great scope of the
      sculptor to heighten nature into heroic beauty, <i>i.e.</i> in
      plain English, to surpass his model. When Canova forms a statue,
      he takes a limb from one, a hand from another, a feature from a
      third, and a shape, it may be, from a fourth, probably at the
      same time improving upon all, as the Greek of old did in
      embodying his Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask a portrait painter to describe his agonies in accommodating
      the faces with which nature and his sitters have crowded his
      painting-room to the principles of his art: with the exception of
      perhaps ten faces in as many millions, there is not one which he
      can venture to give without shading much and adding more. Nature,
      exactly, simply, barely nature, will make no great artist of any
      kind, and least of all a poet&mdash;the most artificial, perhaps,
      of all artists in his very essence. With regard to natural
      imagery, the poets are obliged to take some of their best
      illustrations from <i>art</i>. You say that a <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg364" id="pg364">364</a></span> "fountain is
      as clear or clearer than <i>glass</i>" to express its
      beauty:&mdash;

      If the poet had said that Cassius had run his <i>fist</i> through
      the rent of the mantle, it would have had more of Mr. Bowles's
      "nature" to help it; but the artificial <i>dagger</i> is more
      poetical than any natural <i>hand</i> without it. In the sublime
      of sacred poetry, "Who is this that cometh from Edom? with
      <i>dyed garments</i> from Bozrah?" Would "the comer" be poetical
      without his "<i>dyed garments?</i>" which strike and startle the
      spectator, and identify the approaching object.

      The mother of Sisera is represented listening for the "<i>wheels
      of his chariot</i>." Solomon, in his Song, compares the nose of
      his beloved to "a tower," which to us appears an eastern
      exaggeration. If he had said, that her stature was like that of a
      "tower's," it would have been as poetical as if he had compared
      her to a tree.

        "The virtuous Marcia <i>towers</i> above her sex,"

      is an instance of an artificial image to express a <i>moral</i>
      superiority. But Solomon, it is probable, did not compare his
      beloved's nose to a "tower" on account of its length, but of its
      symmetry; and making allowance for eastern hyperbole, and the
      difficulty of finding a discreet image for a female nose in
      nature, it is perhaps as good a figure as any other.

      Art is <i>not</i> inferior to nature for poetical purposes. What
      makes a regiment of soldiers a more noble object of view than the
      same mass of mob? Their arms, their dresses, their banners, and
      the <i>art</i> and artificial symmetry <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg365" id="pg365">365</a></span> of their
      position and movements. A Highlander's plaid, a Mussulman's
      turban, and a Roman toga, are more poetical than the tattooed or
      untattooed buttocks of a New Sandwich savage, although they were
      described by William Wordsworth himself like the "idiot in his
      glory."
    </p>

      I have seen as many mountains as most men, and more fleets than
      the generality of landsmen; and, to my mind, a large convoy with
      a few sail of the line to conduct them is as noble and as
      poetical a prospect as all that inanimate nature can produce. I
      prefer the "mast of some great ammiral," with all its tackle, to
      the Scotch fir or the alpine tannen; and think that <i>more</i>
      poetry <i>has been</i> made out of it. In what does the infinite
      superiority of "Falconer's Shipwreck" over all other shipwrecks
      consist? In his admirable application of the terms of his art; in
      a poet-sailor's description of the sailor's fate. These <i>very
      terms</i>, by his application, make the strength and reality of
      his poem. Why? because he was a poet, and in the hands of a poet,
      <i>art</i> will not be found less ornamental than nature. It is
      precisely in general nature, and in stepping out of his element,
      that Falconer fails; where he digresses to speak of ancient
      Greece, and "such branches of learning."

      sea and its master. Surely that Roman work (I mean <i>Roman</i>
      in conception and performance), which says to the ocean, "Thus

      sublime and poetical than the angry waves which vainly break

      Mr. Bowles makes the chief part of a ship's poesy depend upon the
      "<i>wind:</i>" then why is a ship under sail more poetical than a
      hog in a high wind? The hog is all nature, the ship is all art,
      "coarse canvass," "blue bunting," and "tall poles;" both are
      violently acted upon by the wind, tossed here and there, to and
      fro, and yet nothing but excess of hunger could make me look upon
      the pig as the more poetical of the two, and then only in the

      We are asked, "What makes the venerable towers of Westminster
      Abbey more poetical, as objects, than the tower for the

      will answer&mdash;the <i>architecture</i>. Turn Westminster
      Abbey, or Saint Paul's <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg367" id=
      "pg367">367</a></span> into a powder magazine, their poetry, as
      objects, remains the same; the Parthenon was actually converted
      into one by the Turks, during Morosini's Venetian siege, and part
      of it destroyed in consequence. Cromwell's dragoons stalled their
      steeds in Worcester cathedral; was it less poetical as an object
      than before? Ask a foreigner on his approach to London, what
      strikes him as the most poetical of the towers before him: he
      will point out Saint Paul's and Westminster Abbey, without,
      perhaps, knowing the names or associations of either, and pass
      over the "tower for patent shot,"&mdash;not that, for any thing
      he knows to the contrary, it might not be the mausoleum of a
      monarch, or a Waterloo column, or a Trafalgar monument, but
      because its architecture is obviously inferior.

      To the question, "Whether the description of a game of cards be
      as poetical, supposing the execution of the artists equal, as a
      description of a walk in a forest?" it may be answered, that the
      <i>materials</i> are certainly not equal; but that "the
      <i>artist</i>," who has rendered the "game of cards poetical," is
      <i>by far the greater</i> of the two. But all this "ordering" of
      poets is purely arbitrary on the part of Mr. Bowles. There may or
      may not be, in fact, different "orders" of poetry, but the poet
      is always ranked according to his execution, and not according to
      his branch of the art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tragedy is one of the highest presumed orders. Hughes has written
      a tragedy, and a very successful one; Fenton another; and Pope
      none. Did any man, however,&mdash;will even Mr. Bowles
      himself,&mdash;rank Hughes and Fenton as poets above <i>Pope</i>?
      Was even Addison (the author of Cato), or Rowe (one of the higher
      order of dramatists as far as success goes), or Young, or even
      Otway and Southerne, ever raised for a moment to the same rank
      with Pope in the estimation of the reader or the critic, before
      his death or since? If Mr. Bowles will contend for
      classifications of this kind, let him recollect that descriptive
      poetry has been <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg368" id=
      "pg368">368</a></span> ranked as among the lowest branches of the
      art, and description as a mere ornament, but which should never
      form the "subject" of a poem. The Italians, with the most
      poetical language, and the most fastidious taste in Europe,
      possess now five <i>great</i> poets, they say, Dante, Petrarch,
      Ariosto, Tasso, and, lastly, Alfieri<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>; and whom do they esteem one of the highest of
      these, and some of them the very highest? Petrarch the
      <i>sonneteer</i>: it is true that some of his Canzoni are <i>not
      less</i> esteemed, but <i>not</i> more; who ever dreams of his
      Latin Africa?
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [Footnote 1: Of these there is one ranked with the others for
        his SONNETS, and <i>two</i> for compositions which belong to
        <i>no class</i> at all? Where is Dante? His poem is not an
        epic; then what is it? He himself calls it a "divine comedy;"
        and why? This is more than all his thousand commentators have
        been able to explain. Ariosto's is not an <i>epic</i> poem; and
        if poets are to be <i>classed</i> according to the <i>genus</i>
        of their poetry, where is he to be placed? Of these five, Tasso
        and Alfieri only come within Aristotle's arrangement, and Mr.
        Bowles's class-book. But the whole position is false. Poets are
        classed by the power of their performance, and not according to
        its rank in a gradus. In the contrary case, the forgotten epic
        poets of all countries would rank above Petrarch, Dante,
        Ariosto, Burns, Gray, Dryden, and the highest names of various
        countries. Mr. Bowles's title of "<i>invariable</i> principles
        of poetry," is, perhaps, the most arrogant ever prefixed to a
        volume. So far are the principles of poetry from being
        "<i>invariable</i>," that they never were nor ever will be
        settled. These "principles" mean nothing more than the
        predilections of a particular age; and every age has its own,
        and a different from its predecessor. It is now Homer, and now
        Virgil; once Dryden, and since Walter Scott; now Corneille, and
        now Racine; now Crebillon, now Voltaire. The Homerists and
        Virgilians in France disputed for half a century. Not fifty
        years ago the Italians neglected Dante&mdash;Bettinelli
        reproved Monti for reading "that barbarian;" at present they
        adore him. Shakspeare and Milton have had their rise, and they
        will have their decline. Already they have more than once
        fluctuated, as must be the case with all the dramatists and
        poets of a living language. This does not depend upon their
        merits, but upon the ordinary vicissitudes of human opinions.
        Schlegel and Madame de Stael have endeavoured also to reduce
        poetry to <i>two</i> systems, classical and romantic. The
        effect is only beginning.]

      Were Petrarch to be ranked according to the "order" of his
      compositions, where would the best of sonnets place him? with
      Dante and the others? no; but, as I have before said, the poet
      who <i>executes</i> best, is the highest, whatever his
      department, and will ever be so rated in the world's esteem.

      Had Gray written nothing but his Elegy, high as he stands, I am
      not sure that he would not stand higher; it is the corner-stone
      of his glory: without it, his odes would be insufficient for his
      fame. The depreciation of Pope is partly founded upon a false
      idea of the dignity of his order of poetry, to which he has
      partly contributed by the ingenuous boast,

        "That not in fancy's maze he wandered long,

      He should have written "rose to truth." In my mind, the highest
      of all poetry is ethical poetry, as the highest of all earthly
      objects must be moral truth. Religion does not make a part of my
      subject; it is something beyond human powers, and has failed in
      all human hands except Milton's and Dante's, and even Dante's
      powers are involved in his delineation of human passions, though
      in supernatural circumstances. What made Socrates the greatest of
      men? His moral truth&mdash;his ethics. What proved Jesus Christ
      the Son of God hardly less than his miracles? His moral precepts.
      And if ethics have made a philosopher the first of men, and have
      not been disdained as an adjunct to his Gospel by the Deity
      himself, are we to be told that ethical poetry, or didactic
      poetry, or by whatever name you term it, whose object is to make
      men better and wiser, is not the <i>very first order</i> of
      poetry; and are we to be told this too by one of the priesthood?
      It requires more mind, more wisdom, more power, than all the
      "forests" that ever were "walked" for their "description," and
      all the epics that ever were founded upon fields of battle. The
      Georgics are indisputably, and, I believe, <span class=

      <i>undisputedly</i> even a finer poem than the Æneid. Virgil knew

      It is the fashion of the day to lay great stress upon what they
      call "imagination" and "invention," the two commonest of
      qualities: an Irish peasant with a little whiskey in his head
      will imagine and invent more than would furnish forth a modern
      poem. If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system,
      we should have had a far superior poem to any now in existence.
      As mere poetry, it is the first of Latin poems. What then has
      ruined it? His ethics. Pope has not this defect; his moral is as
      pure as his poetry is glorious.

      In speaking of artificial objects, I have omitted to touch upon
      one which I will now mention. Cannon may be presumed to be as
      highly poetical as art can make her objects. Mr. Bowles will,
      perhaps, tell me that this is because they resemble that grand
      natural article of sound in heaven, and simile upon
      earth&mdash;thunder. I shall be told triumphantly, that Milton
      made sad work with his artillery, when he armed his devils
      therewithal. He did so; and this artificial object must have had
      much of the sublime to attract his attention for such a conflict.
      He <i>has</i> made an absurd use of it; but the absurdity
      consists not in using <i>cannon</i> against the angels of God,
      but any <i>material</i> weapon. The thunder of the clouds would
      have been as ridiculous and vain in the hands of the devils, as
      the "villanous saltpetre:" the angels were as impervious to the
      one as to the other. The thunderbolts become sublime in the hands
      of the Almighty not as such, but because <i>he</i> deigns to use
      them as a means of repelling the rebel spirits; but no one can
      attribute their defeat to this grand piece of natural
      electricity: the Almighty willed, and they fell; his word would
      have been enough; and Milton is as absurd, (and, in fact,
      <i>blasphemous</i>,) in putting material lightnings into the
      hands of the Godhead, as in giving him hands at all. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg371" id="pg371">371</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The artillery of the demons was but the first step of his
      mistake, the thunder the next, and it is a step lower. It would
      have been fit for Jove, but not for Jehovah. The subject
      altogether was essentially unpoetical; he has made more of it
      than another could, but it is beyond him and all men.

      In a portion of his reply, Mr. Bowles asserts that Pope "envied
      Phillips," because he quizzed his pastorals in the Guardian, in
      that most admirable model of irony, his paper on the subject. If
      there was any thing enviable about Phillips, it could hardly be
      his pastorals. They were despicable, and Pope expressed his
      contempt. If Mr. Fitzgerald published a volume of sonnets, or a
      "Spirit of Discovery," or a "Missionary," and Mr. Bowles wrote in
      any periodical journal an ironical paper upon them, would this be
      "envy?" The authors of the "Rejected Addresses" have ridiculed
      the sixteen or twenty "first living poets" of the day, but do
      they "envy" them? "Envy" writhes, it don't laugh. The authors of
      the Rejected Addresses may despise some, but they can hardly
      "envy" any of the persons whom they have parodied; and Pope could
      have no more envied Phillips than he did Welsted, or Theobald, or
      Smedley, or any other given hero of the Dunciad. He could not
      have envied him, even had he himself <i>not</i> been the greatest
      poet of his age. Did Mr. Ings "<i>envy</i>" Mr. Phillips when he
      asked him, "How came your Pyrrhus to drive oxen and say, I am
      <i>goaded</i> on by love?" This question silenced poor Phillips;
      but it no more proceeded from "envy" than did Pope's ridicule.
      Did he envy Swift? Did he envy Bolingbroke? Did he envy Gay the
      unparalleled success of his "Beggar's Opera?" We may be answered
      that these were his friends&mdash;true: but does
      <i>friendship</i> prevent <i>envy</i>? Study the first woman you
      meet with, or the first scribbler, let Mr. Bowles himself (whom I
      acquit fully of such an odious quality) study some of his own
      poetical intimates: the most envious man I ever heard of is a
      poet, and a high <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg372" id=
      "pg372">372</a></span> one; besides, it is an <i>universal</i>
      passion. Goldsmith envied not only the puppets for their dancing,
      and broke his shins in the attempt at rivalry, but was seriously
      angry because two pretty women received more attention than he
      did. <i>This is envy;</i> but where does Pope show a sign of the
      passion? In that case Dryden envied the hero of his Mac Flecknoe.
      Mr. Bowles compares, when and where he can, Pope with
      Cowper&mdash;(the same Cowper whom in his edition of Pope he
      laughs at for his attachment to an old woman, Mrs. Unwin; search
      and you will find it; I remember the passage, though not the
      page;) in particular he requotes Cowper's Dutch delineation of a
      wood, drawn up, like a seedsman's catalogue<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, with an affected imitation of Milton's style,
      as <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg373" id=
      "pg373">373</a></span> burlesque as the "Splendid Shilling."
      These two writers, for Cowper is no poet, come into comparison in
      one great work, the translation of Homer. Now, with all the
      great, and manifest, and manifold, and reproved, and
      acknowledged, and uncontroverted faults of Pope's translation,
      and all the scholarship, and pains, and time, and trouble, and
      blank verse of the other, who can ever read Cowper? and who will
      ever lay down Pope, unless for the original? Pope's was "not
      Homer, it was Spondanus;" but Cowper's is not Homer either, it is
      not even Cowper. As a child I first read Pope's Homer with a
      rapture which no subsequent work could ever afford, and children
      are not the worst judges of their own language. As a boy I read
      Homer in the original, as we have all done, some of us by force,
      and a few by favour; under which description I come is nothing to
      the purpose, it is enough that I read him. As a man I have tried
      to read Cowper's version, and I found it impossible. Has any
      human reader ever succeeded?

        ordinary image; I refer Mr. Bowles to the stanza, and ask if
        these three lines about "<i>needles</i>" are not worth all the
        boasted twaddling about trees, so triumphantly re-quoted? and
        yet, in <i>fact</i>, what do they convey? A homely collection
        of images and ideas, associated with the darning of stockings,
        and the hemming of shirts, and the mending of breeches; but
        will any one deny that they are eminently poetical and pathetic
        as addressed by Cowper to his nurse? The trash of trees reminds
        me of a saying of Sheridan's. Soon after the "Rejected Address"
        scene in 1812, I met Sheridan. In the course of dinner, he
        said, "Lord Byron, did you know that, amongst the writers of
        addresses, was Whitbread himself?" I answered by an enquiry of
        what sort of an address he had made. "Of that," replied
        Sheridan, "I remember little, except that there was a
        <i>phoenix</i> in it."&mdash;"A phoenix!! Well, how did he
        describe it?"&mdash;"<i>Like a poulterer</i>," answered
        Sheridan: "it was green, and yellow, and red, and blue: he did
        not let us off for a single feather." And just such as this
        poulterer's account of a phoenix is Cowper's stick-picker's
        detail of a wood, with all its petty minutiæ of this, that, and
        the other.]

      And now that we have heard the Catholic repreached <span class=

      duplicity, licentiousness, avarice&mdash;what was the Calvinist?
      He attempted the most atrocious of crimes in the Christian code,
      viz. suicide&mdash;and why? because he was to be examined whether
      he was fit for an office which he seems to wish to have made a
      sinecure. His connection with Mrs. Unwin was pure enough, for the
      old lady was devout, and he was deranged; but why then is the
      infirm and then elderly Pope to be reproved for his connection
      with Martha Blount: Cowper was the almoner of Mrs. Throgmorton;
      but Pope's charities were his own, and they were noble and
      extensive, far beyond his fortune's warrant. Pope was the
      tolerant yet steady adherent of the most bigoted of sects; and
      Cowper the most bigoted and despondent sectary that ever
      anticipated damnation to himself or others. Is this harsh? I know
      it is, and I do not assert it as my opinion of Cowper
      <i>personally</i>, but to <i>show what might</i> be said, with
      just as great an appearance of truth and candour, as all the
      odium which has been accumulated upon Pope in similar
      speculations. Cowper was a good man, and lived at a fortunate
      time for his works.

      Mr. Bowles, apparently not relying entirely upon his own

      only in the short work intended for publication, and in private
      letters which can never be published, has or has not been the
      same. I look upon this as the declining age of English poetry; no
      regard for others, no selfish feeling, can prevent me from seeing
      this, and expressing the truth. There can be no worse sign for
      the taste of the times than the depreciation of Pope. It would be
      better to receive for proof Mr. Cobbett's rough but strong attack
      upon Shakspeare and Milton, than to allow this smooth and
      "candid" undermining of the reputation of the most <i>perfect</i>
      of our poets, and the purest of our moralists. Of his power in
      the <i>passions</i>, in description, in the mock heroic, I leave
      others to descant. I take him on his strong ground as an
      <i>ethical</i> poet: in the former, none excel; in the mock
      heroic and the ethical, none equal him; and in my mind, the
      latter is the highest of all poetry, because it does that in
      <i>verse</i>, which the greatest of men have wished to accomplish
      in prose. If the essence of poetry must be a <i>lie</i>, throw it
      to the dogs, or banish it from your republic, as Plato would have
      done. He who can reconcile poetry with truth and wisdom, is the
      only true "<i>poet</i>" in its real sense, "the <i>maker</i>"
      "the <i>creator</i>,"&mdash;why must this mean the "liar," the
      "feigner," the "tale-teller?" A man may make and create better
      things than these.

    <p>
      I shall not presume to say that Pope is as high a poet as
      Shakspeare and Milton, though his enemy, Warton, places him
      immediately under them.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> I would no
      more <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg377" id=
      "pg377">377</a></span> say this than I would assert in the mosque
      (once Saint Sophia's), that Socrates was a greater man than
      Mahomet. But if I say that he is very near them, it is no more
      than has been asserted of Burns, who is supposed

        [Footnote 1: If the opinions cited by Mr. Bowles, of Dr.
        Johnson <i>against</i> Pope, are to be taken as decisive
        authority, they will also hold good against Gray, Milton,
        Swift, Thomson, and Dryden: in that case what becomes of Gray's
        poetical, and Milton's moral character? even of Milton's
        <i>poetical</i> character, or, indeed, of <i>English</i> poetry
        in general? for Johnson strips many a leaf from every laurel.
        Still Johnson's is the finest critical work extant, and can
        never be read without instruction and delight.]

      I say nothing against this opinion. But of what "<i>order</i>,"
      according to the poetical aristocracy, are Burns's poems? There
      are his <i>opus magnum</i>, "Tam O'Shanter," a <i>tale</i>; the
      Cotter's Saturday Night, a descriptive sketch; some others in the
      same style: the rest are songs. So much for the <i>rank</i> of
      his <i>productions</i>; the <i>rank</i> of <i>Burns</i> is the
      very first of his art. Of Pope I have expressed my opinion
      elsewhere, as also of the effect which the present attempts at
      poetry have had upon our literature. If any great national or
      natural convulsion could or should overwhelm your country in such
      sort, as to sweep Great Britain from the kingdoms of the earth,
      and leave only that, after all, the most living of human things,
      a <i>dead language</i>, to be studied and read, and imitated by
      the wise of future and far generations, upon foreign shores; if
      your literature should become the learning of mankind, divested
      of party cabals, temporary fashions, and national pride and
      prejudice; an Englishman, anxious that the posterity of strangers
      should know that there had been such a thing as a British Epic
      and Tragedy, might wish for the preservation of Shakspeare and
      Milton; but the surviving world would snatch Pope from the wreck,
      and let the rest sink with the people. He is the moral poet of
      all civilisation; and as such, let us hope that he will one day
      be the national poet of mankind. He is the only poet that never
      shocks; the only poet whose <i>faultlessness</i> has been made
      his reproach. Cast your eye over his productions; consider their
      extent, and contemplate their variety:&mdash;pastoral, passion,
      mock heroic, translation, satire, ethics,&mdash;all excellent,
      and often perfect. If his great charm be his <i>melody</i>, how
      comes it that foreigners <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg378"
      id="pg378">378</a></span> adore him even in their diluted
      translations? But I have made this letter too long. Give my
      compliments to Mr. Bowles.

    <p>
      <i>To John Murray, Esq</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Post Scriptum</i>.&mdash;Long as this letter has grown, I find
      it necessary to append a postscript; if possible, a short one.
      Mr. Bowles denies that he has accused Pope of "a sordid
      money-getting passion;" but, he adds, "if I had ever done so, I
      should be glad to find any testimony that, might show he was
      <i>not</i> so." This testimony he may find to his heart's content
      in Spence and elsewhere. First, there is Martha Blount, who, Mr.
      Bowles charitably says, "probably thought he did not save enough
      for her, as legatee." Whatever she <i>thought</i> upon this
      point, her words are in Pope's favour. Then there is Alderman
      Barber; see Spence's Anecdotes. There is Pope's cold answer to
      Halifax when he proposed a pension; his behaviour to Craggs and
      to Addison upon like occasions, and his own two lines&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "And, thanks to Homer, since I live and thrive,
      </p>
      <p>
        Indebted to no prince or peer alive;"
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      written when princes would have been proud to pension, and peers
      to promote him, and when the whole army of dunces were in array
      against him, and would have been but too happy to deprive him of
      this boast of independence. But there is something a little more
      serious in Mr. Bowles's declaration, that he "<i>would</i> have
      spoken" of his "noble generosity to the outcast Richard Savage,"
      and other instances of a compassionate and generous heart,
      "<i>had they occurred to his recollection when he wrote</i>."
      What! is it come to this? Does Mr. Bowles sit down to write a
      minute and laboured life and edition of a great poet? Does he
      anatomise his character, moral and poetical? Does he present us
      with his faults and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg379" id=
      "pg379">379</a></span> with his foibles? Does he sneer at his
      feelings, and doubt of his sincerity? Does he unfold his vanity
      and duplicity? and then omit the good qualities which might, in
      part, have "covered this multitude of sins?" and then plead that
      "<i>they did not occur to his recollection</i>?" Is this the
      frame of mind and of memory with which the illustrious dead are
      to be approached? If Mr. Bowles, who must have had access to all
      the means of refreshing his memory, did not recollect these
      facts, he is unfit for his task; but if he <i>did</i> recollect
      and omit them, I know not what he is fit for, but I know what
      would be fit for him. Is the plea of "not recollecting" such
      prominent facts to be admitted? Mr. Bowles has been at a public
      school, and as I have been publicly educated also, I can
      sympathise with his predilection. When we were in the third form
      even, had we pleaded on the Monday morning, that we had not
      brought up the Saturday's exercise, because "we had forgotten
      it," what would have been the reply? And is an excuse, which
      would not be pardoned to a schoolboy, to pass current in a matter
      which so nearly concerns the fame of the first poet of his age,
      if not of his country? If Mr. Bowles so readily forgets the
      virtues of others, why complain so grievously that others have a
      better memory for his own faults? They are but the faults of an
      author; while the virtues he omitted from his catalogue are
      essential to the justice due to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles appears, indeed, to be susceptible beyond the
      privilege of authorship. There is a plaintive dedication to Mr.
      Gifford, in which <i>he</i> is made responsible for all the
      articles of the Quarterly. Mr. Southey, it seems, "the most able
      and eloquent writer in that Review," approves of Mr. Bowles's
      publication. Now it seems to me the more impartial, that
      notwithstanding that "the great writer of the Quarterly"
      entertains opinions opposite to the able article on Spence,
      nevertheless that essay was permitted to appear. Is a review to
      be devoted to the opinions of any <i>one</i> man? <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg380" id="pg380">380</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Must it not vary according to circumstances, and according to the
      subjects to be criticised? I fear that writers must take the
      sweets and bitters of the public journals as they occur, and an
      author of so long a standing as Mr. Bowles might have become
      accustomed to such incidents; he might be angry, but not
      astonished. I have been reviewed in the Quarterly almost as often
      as Mr. Bowles, and have had as pleasant things said, and some
      <i>as unpleasant</i>, as could well be pronounced. In the review
      of "The Fall of Jerusalem" it is stated, that I have devoted "my
      powers, &amp;c. to the worst parts of Manicheism;" which, being
      interpreted, means that I worship the devil. Now, I have neither
      written a reply, nor complained to Gifford. I believe that I
      observed in a letter to you, that I thought "that the critic
      might have praised Milman without finding it necessary to abuse
      me;" but did I not add at the same time, or soon after, (à
      propos, of the note in the book of Travels,) that I would not, if
      it were even in my power, have a single line cancelled on my
      account in that nor in any other publication? Of course, I
      reserve to myself the privilege of response when necessary. Mr.
      Bowles seems in a whimsical state about the author of the article
      on Spence. You know very well that I am not in your confidence,
      nor in that of the conductor of the journal. The moment I saw
      that article, I was morally certain that I knew the author "by
      his style." You will tell me that I do <i>not know</i> him: that
      is all as it should be; keep the secret, so shall I, though no
      one has ever intrusted it to me. He is not the person whom Mr.
      Bowles denounces. Mr. Bowles's extreme sensibility reminds me of
      a circumstance which occurred on board of a frigate in which I
      was a passenger and guest of the captain's for a considerable
      time. The surgeon on board, a very gentlemanly young man, and
      remarkably able in his profession, wore a <i>wig</i>. Upon this
      ornament he was extremely tenacious. As naval jests are sometimes
      a little rough, his brother officers made occasional <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg381" id="pg381">381</a></span> allusions to
      this delicate appendage to the doctor's person. One day a young
      lieutenant, in the course of a facetious discussion, said,
      "Suppose now, doctor, I should take off your
      <i>hat</i>,"&mdash;"Sir," replied the doctor, "I shall talk no
      longer with you; you grow <i>scurrilous</i>." He would not even
      admit so near an approach as to the hat which protected it. In
      like manner, if any body approaches Mr. Bowles's laurels, even in
      his outside capacity of an <i>editor</i>, "they grow
      <i>scurrilous</i>." You say that you are about to prepare an
      edition of Pope; you cannot do better for your own credit as a
      publisher, nor for the redemption of Pope from Mr. Bowles, and of
      the public taste from rapid degeneracy. <span class=

    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      In the further "Observations" of Mr. Bowles, in rejoinder to the
      charges brought against his edition of Pope, it is to be
      regretted that he has lost his temper. Whatever the language of
      his antagonists may have been, I fear that his replies have
      afforded more pleasure to them than to the public. That Mr.
      Bowles should not be pleased is natural, whether right or wrong;
      but a temperate defence would have answered his purpose in the
      former case&mdash;and, in the latter, no defence, however
      violent, can tend to any thing but his discomfiture. I have read
      over this third pamphlet, which you have been so obliging as to
      send me, and shall venture a few observations, in addition to
      those upon the previous controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles sets out with repeating his "<i>confirmed
      conviction</i>," that "what he said of the moral part of Pope's
      character was, generally speaking, true; and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg383" id="pg383">383</a></span> that the
      principles of <i>poetical</i> criticism which he has laid down
      are <i>invariable</i> and <i>invulnerable</i>," &amp;c.; and that
      he is the <i>more</i> persuaded of this by the
      "<i>exaggerations</i> of his opponents." This is all very well,
      and highly natural and sincere. Nobody ever expected that either
      Mr. Bowles, or any other author, would be convinced of human
      fallibility in their own persons. But it is nothing to the
      purpose&mdash;for it is not what Mr. Bowles thinks, but what is
      to be thought of Pope, that is the question. It is what he has
      asserted or insinuated against a name which is the patrimony of
      posterity, that is to be tried; and Mr. Bowles, as a party, can
      be no judge. The more <i>he</i> is persuaded, the better for
      himself, if it give him any pleasure; but he can only persuade
      others by the proofs brought out in his defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these prefatory remarks of "conviction," &amp;c. Mr. Bowles
      proceeds to Mr. Gilchrist; whom he charges with "slang" and
      "slander," besides a small subsidiary indictment of "abuse,
      ignorance, malice," and so forth. Mr. Gilchrist has, indeed,
      shown some anger; but it is an honest indignation, which rises up
      in defence of the illustrious dead. It is a generous rage which
      interposes between our ashes and their disturbers. There appears
      also to have been some slight personal provocation. Mr.
      Gilchrist, with a chivalrous disdain of the fury of an incensed
      poet, put his name to a letter avowing the production of a former
      essay in defence of Pope, and consequently of an attack upon Mr.
      Bowles. Mr. Bowles appears to be angry with Mr. Gilchrist for
      four reasons:&mdash;firstly, because he wrote an article in "The
      London Magazine;" secondly, because he afterwards avowed it;
      thirdly, because he was the author of a still more extended
      article in "The Quarterly Review;" and, fourthly, because he was
      NOT the author of the said Quarterly article, and had the
      audacity to disown it&mdash;for no earthly reason but because he
      had NOT written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles declares, that "he will not enter into a <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg384" id="pg384">384</a></span> particular
      examination of the pamphlet," which by a <i>misnomer</i> is
      called "Gilchrist's Answer to Bowles," when it should have been
      called "Gilchrist's Abuse of Bowles." On this error in the
      baptism of Mr. Gilchrist's pamphlet, it may be observed, that an
      answer may be abusive and yet no less an answer, though
      indisputably a temperate one might be the better of the two: but
      if <i>abuse</i> is to cancel all pretensions to reply, what
      becomes of Mr. Bowles's answers to Mr. Gilchrist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles continues:&mdash;"But as Mr. Gilchrist derides my
      <i>peculiar sensitiveness to criticism</i>, before I show how
      <i>destitute of truth is this representation</i>, I will here
      explicitly declare the only grounds," &amp;c. &amp;c.
      &amp;c.&mdash;Mr. Bowles's sensibility in denying his
      "sensitiveness to criticism" proves, perhaps, too much. But if he
      has been so charged, and truly&mdash;what then? There is no moral
      turpitude in such acuteness of feeling: it has been, and may be,
      combined with many good and great qualities. Is Mr. Bowles a
      poet, or is he not? If he be, he must, from his very essence, be
      sensitive to criticism; and even if he be not, he need not be
      ashamed of the common repugnance to being attacked. All that is
      to be wished is, that he had considered how disagreeable a thing
      it is, before he assailed the greatest moral poet of any age, or
      in any language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope himself "sleeps well,"&mdash;nothing can touch him further;
      but those who love the honour of their country, the perfection of
      her literature, the glory of her language&mdash;are not to be
      expected to permit an atom of his dust to be stirred in his tomb,
      or a leaf to be stripped from the laurel which grows over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles assigns several reasons why and when "an author is
      justified in appealing to every <i>upright</i> and
      <i>honourable</i> mind in the kingdom." If Mr. Bowles limits the
      perusal of his defence to the "upright and honourable" only, I
      greatly fear that it will not be extensively circulated. I should
      rather hope that some <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg385" id=
      "pg385">385</a></span> of the downright and dishonest will read
      and be converted, or convicted. But the whole of his reasoning is
      here superfluous&mdash;"<i>an author is justified in
      appealing</i>," &amp;c. when and why he pleases. Let him make out
      a tolerable case, and few of his readers will quarrel with his
      motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles "will now plainly set before the literary public all
      the circumstances which have led to <i>his name</i> and Mr.
      Gilchrist's being brought together," &amp;c. Courtesy requires,
      in speaking of others and ourselves, that we should place the
      name of the former first&mdash;and not "<i>Ego</i> et Rex meus."
      Mr. Bowles should have written "Mr. Gilchrist's name and his."
    </p>
    <p>
      This point he wishes "particularly to address to those <i>most
      respectable characters</i>, who have the direction and management
      of the periodical critical press." That the press may be, in some
      instances, conducted by respectable characters is probable
      enough; but if they are so, there is no occasion to tell them of
      it; and if they are not, it is a base adulation. In either case,
      it looks like a kind of flattery, by which those gentry are not
      very likely to be softened; since it would be difficult to find
      two passages in fifteen pages more at variance, than Mr. Bowles's
      prose at the beginning of this pamphlet, and his verse at the end
      of it. In page 4. he speaks of "those most respectable characters
      who have the direction, &amp;c. of the periodical press," and in
      page 10. we find&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Ye <i>dark inquisitors</i>, a monk-like band,
      </p>
      <p>
        Who o'er some shrinking victim-author stand,
      </p>
      <p>
        A solemn, secret, and <i>vindictive brand</i>,
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Only</i> terrific in your cowl and hood."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      And so on&mdash;to "bloody law" and "red scourges," with other
      similar phrases, which may not be altogether agreeable to the
      above-mentioned "most respectable characters." Mr. Bowles goes
      on, "I concluded my observations in the last Pamphleteer with
      feelings <i>not unkind</i> towards Mr. Gilchrist, or" [it should
      be <i>nor</i>] <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg386" id=
      "pg386">386</a></span> "to the author of the review of Spence, be
      he whom he might."&mdash;"I was in hopes, <i>as I have always
      been ready to admit any errors</i> I might have been led into, or
      prejudice I might have entertained, that even Mr. Gilchrist might
      be disposed to a more <i>amicable</i> mode of discussing what I
      had advanced in regard to Pope's moral character." As Major
      Sturgeon observes, "There never was a set of more <i>amicable</i>
      officers&mdash;with the exception of a boxing-bout between
      Captain Shears and the Colonel."
    </p>
    <p>
      A page and a half&mdash;nay only a page before&mdash;Mr. Bowles
      re-affirms his conviction, that "what he has said of Pope's moral
      character is <i>(generally speaking) true,</i> and that his
      "poetical principles are <i>invariable</i> and
      <i>invulnerable</i>." He has also published three
      pamphlets,&mdash;ay, four of the same tenour,&mdash;and yet, with
      this declaration and these declamations staring him and his
      adversaries in the face, he speaks of his "readiness to admit
      errors or to abandon prejudices!!!" His use of the word
      "amicable" reminds me of the Irish Institution (which I have
      somewhere heard or read of) called the "<i>Friendly</i> Society,"
      where the president always carried pistols in his pocket, so that
      when one amicable gentleman knocked down another, the difference
      might be adjusted on the spot, at the harmonious distance of
      twelve paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bowles "has since read a publication by him (Mr.
      Gilchrist) containing such vulgar slander, affecting private life
      and character," &amp;c. &amp;c.; and Mr. Gilchrist has also had
      the advantage of reading a publication by Mr. Bowles sufficiently
      imbued with personality; for one of the first and principal
      topics of reproach is that he is a <i>grocer</i>, that he has a
      "pipe in his mouth, ledger-book, green canisters, dingy shop-boy,
      half a hogshead of brown treacle," &amp;c. Nay, the same delicate
      raillery is upon the very title-page. When controversy has once
      commenced upon this footing, as Dr. Johnson said to Dr. Percy,
      "Sir, there is an end of politeness&mdash;we are to be as rude as
      we please&mdash;Sir, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg387" id=
      "pg387">387</a></span> you said that I was <i>short-sighted</i>."
      As a man's profession is generally no more in his own power than
      his person&mdash;both having been made out for him&mdash;it is
      hard that he should be reproached with either, and still more
      that an honest calling should be made a reproach. If there is any
      thing more honourable to Mr. Gilchrist than another it is, that
      being engaged in commerce he has had the taste, and found the
      leisure, to become so able a proficient in the higher literature
      of his own and other countries. Mr. Bowles, who will be proud to
      own Glover, Chatterton, Burns, and Bloomfleld for his peers,
      should hardly have quarrelled with Mr. Gilchrist for his critic.
      Mr. Gilchrist's station, however, which might conduct him to the
      highest civic honours, and to boundless wealth, has nothing to
      require apology; but even if it had, such a reproach was not very
      gracious on the part of a clergyman, nor graceful on that of a
      gentleman. The allusion to "<i>Christian</i> criticism" is not
      particularly happy, especially where Mr. Gilchrist is accused of
      having "<i>set the first example of this mode in Europe</i>."
      What <i>Pagan</i> criticism may have been we know but little; the
      names of Zoilus and Aristarchus survive, and the works of
      Aristotle, Longinus, and Quintilian: but of "Christian criticism"
      we have already had some specimens in the works of Philelphus,
      Poggius, Scaliger, Milton, Salmasius, the Cruscanti (versus
      Tasso), the French Academy (against the Cid), and the antagonists
      of Voltaire and of Pope&mdash;to say nothing of some articles in
      most of the reviews, since their earliest institution in the
      person of their respectable and still prolific parent, "The
      Monthly." Why, then, is Mr. Gilchrist to be singled out "as
      having set the first example?" A sole page of Milton or Salmasius
      contains more abuse&mdash;rank, rancorous, <i>unleavened</i>
      abuse&mdash;than all that can be raked forth from the whole works
      of many recent critics. There are some, indeed, who still keep up
      the good old custom; but fewer English than foreign. It is a pity
      that <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg388" id=
      "pg388">388</a></span> Mr. Bowles cannot witness some of the
      Italian controversies, or become the subject of one. He would
      then look upon Mr. Gilchrist as a panegyrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long sentence quoted from the article in "The London
      Magazine," there is one coarse image, the justice of whose
      application I shall not pretend to determine:&mdash;"The
      pruriency with which his nose is laid to the ground" is an
      expression which, whether founded or not, might have been
      omitted. But the "anatomical minuteness" appears to me justified
      even by Mr. Bowles's own subsequent quotation. To the
      point:&mdash;"<i>Many facts</i> tend to prove the peculiar
      susceptibility of his passions; nor can we implicitly believe
      that the connexion between him and Martha Blount was of a nature
      so pure and innocent as his panegyrist Ruffhead would have us
      believe," &amp;c.&mdash;"At <i>no time</i> could she have
      regarded <i>Pope personally</i> with attachment,"
      &amp;c.&mdash;"But the most extraordinary circumstance in regard
      to his connexion with female society, was the strange mixture of
      <i>indecent</i> and even <i>profane</i> levity which his conduct
      and language often exhibited. The cause of this particularity may
      be sought, perhaps, in his consciousness of physical defect,
      which made him affect a character uncongenial, and a language
      opposite to the truth."&mdash;If this is not "minute moral
      anatomy," I should be glad to know what is! It is dissection in
      all its branches. I shall, however, hazard a remark or two upon
      this quotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me it appears of no very great consequence whether Martha
      Blount was or was not Pope's mistress, though I could have wished
      him a better. She appears to have been a cold-hearted,
      interested, ignorant, disagreeable woman, upon whom the
      tenderness of Pope's heart in the desolation of his latter days
      was cast away, not knowing whither to turn as he drew towards his
      premature old age, childless and lonely,&mdash;like the needle
      which, approaching within a certain distance of the pole, becomes
      helpless and useless, and, ceasing to tremble, rusts. She seems
      to have been so totally unworthy of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg389" id="pg389">389</a></span> tenderness,
      that it is an additional proof of the kindness of Pope's heart to
      have been able to love such a being. But we must love something.
      I agree with Mr. B. that <i>she</i> "could at no time have
      regarded <i>Pope personally</i> with attachment," because she was
      incapable of attachment; but I deny that Pope could not be
      regarded with personal attachment by a worthier woman. It is not
      probable, indeed, that a woman would have fallen in love with him
      as he walked along the Mall, or in a box at the opera, nor from a
      balcony, nor in a ball-room; but in society he seems to have been
      as amiable as unassuming, and, with the greatest disadvantages of
      figure, his head and face were remarkably handsome, especially
      his eyes. He was adored by his friends&mdash;friends of the most
      opposite dispositions, ages, and talents&mdash;by the old and
      wayward Wycherley, by the cynical Swift, the rough Atterbury, the
      gentle Spence, the stern attorney-bishop Warburton, the virtuous
      Berkeley, and the "cankered Bolingbroke." Bolingbroke wept over
      him like a child; and Spence's description of his last moments is
      at least as edifying as the more ostentatious account of the
      deathbed of Addison. The soldier Peterborough and the poet Gay,
      the witty Congreve and the laughing Rowe, the eccentric Cromwell
      and the steady Bathurst, were all his intimates. The man who
      could conciliate so many men of the most opposite description,
      not one of whom but was a remarkable or a celebrated character,
      might well have pretended to all the attachment which a
      reasonable man would desire of an amiable woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope, in fact, wherever he got it, appears to have understood the
      sex well, Bolingbroke, "a judge of the subject," says Warton,
      thought his "Epistle on the Characters of Women" his
      "masterpiece." And even with respect to the grosser passion,
      which takes occasionally the name of "<i>romantic</i>,"
      accordingly as the degree of sentiment elevates it above the
      definition of love by Buffon, it may be remarked, that it does
      not always <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg390" id=
      "pg390">390</a></span> depend upon personal appearance, even in a
      woman. Madame Cottin was a plain woman, and might have been
      virtuous, it may be presumed, without much interruption. Virtuous
      she was, and the consequences of this inveterate virtue were that
      two different admirers (one an elderly gentleman) killed
      themselves in despair (see Lady Morgan's "France"). I would not,
      however, recommend this rigour to plain women in general, in the
      hope of securing the glory of two suicides apiece. I believe that
      there are few men who, in the course of their observations on
      life, may not have perceived that it is not the greatest female
      beauty who forms the longest and the strongest passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, apropos of Pope.&mdash;Voltaire tells us that the Marechal
      Luxembourg (who had precisely Pope's figure) was not only
      somewhat too amatory for a great man, but fortunate in his
      attachments. La Valière, the passion of Louis XIV., had an
      unsightly defect. The Princess of Eboli, the mistress of Philip
      II. of Spain, and Maugiron, the minion of Henry III. of France,
      had each of them lost an eye; and the famous Latin epigram was
      written upon them, which has, I believe, been either translated
      or imitated by Goldsmith:&mdash;

      For my own part, I am of the opinion of Pausanias. that success
      in love depends upon Fortune. "They particularly renounce
      Celestial Venus, into whose temple, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I
      remember, too, to have seen a building in Ægina in which there is
      a statue of Fortune, holding a horn of Amalthea; and near her
      there is a winged Love. The meaning of this is, that the success
      of men in love affairs depends more on the assistance of Fortune
      than the charms of beauty. I am persuaded, too, with Pindar (to
      whose opinion I submit in other particulars), that Fortune is one
      of the Fates, and that in a certain respect she is more powerful
      than her sisters."&mdash;See Pausanias, Achaics, book vii.

      Grimm has a remark of the same kind on the different destinies of
      the younger Crebillon and Rousseau. The former writes a
      licentious novel, and a young English girl of some fortune and
      family (a Miss Strafford) runs away, and crosses the sea to marry
      him; while Rousseau, the most tender and passionate of lovers, is
      obliged to espouse his chambermaid. If I recollect rightly, this
      remark was also repeated in the Edinburgh Review of Grimm's
      correspondence, seven or eight years ago.

    <p>
      In regard "to the strange mixture of indecent, and sometimes
      <i>profane</i> levity, which his conduct and language
      <i>often</i> exhibited," and which so much shocks Mr. Bowles, I
      object to the indefinite word "<i>often</i>;" and in extenuation
      of the occasional occurrence of such language it is to be
      recollected, that it was less the tone of <i>Pope</i>, than the
      tone of the <i>time</i>. With the exception of the correspondence
      of Pope and his friends, not many private letters of the period
      have come down to us; but those, such as they are&mdash;a few
      scattered scraps from Farquhar and others&mdash;are more indecent
      and coarse than any thing in Pope's letters. The comedies of
      Congreve, Vanbrugh, Farquhar, Cibber, &amp;c., which <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg392" id="pg392">392</a></span> naturally
      attempted to represent the manners and conversation of private
      life, are decisive upon this point; as are also some of Steele's
      papers, and even Addison's. We all know what the conversation of
      Sir R. Walpole, for seventeen years the prime minister of the
      country, was at his own table, and his excuse for his licentious
      language, viz. "that every body understood <i>that</i>, but few
      could talk rationally upon less common topics." The refinement of
      latter days,&mdash;which is perhaps the consequence of vice,
      which wishes to mask and soften itself, as much as of virtuous
      civilisation,&mdash;had not yet made sufficient progress. Even
      Johnson, in his "London," has two or three passages which cannot
      be read aloud, and Addison's "Drummer" some indelicate allusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of Mr. Bowles, "his consciousness of physical
      defect," is not very clear. It may mean deformity or debility. If
      it alludes to Pope's deformity, it has been attempted to be shown
      that this was no insuperable objection to his being beloved. If
      it alludes to debility, as a consequence of Pope's peculiar
      conformation, I believe that it is a physical and known fact that
      hump-backed persons are of strong and vigorous passions. Several
      years ago, at Mr. Angelo's fencing rooms, when I was a pupil of
      him and of Mr. Jackson, who had the use of his rooms in Albany on
      the alternate days, I recollect a gentleman named
      B&mdash;ll&mdash;gh&mdash;t, remarkable for his strength, and the
      fineness of his figure. His skill was not inferior, for he could
      stand up to the great Captain Barclay himself, with the muffles
      on;&mdash;a task neither easy nor agreeable to a pugilistic
      aspirant. As the by-standers were one day admiring his athletic
      proportions, he remarked to us, that he had five brothers as tall
      and strong as himself, and that their <i>father and mother were
      both crooked, and of very small stature</i>;&mdash;I think he
      said, neither of them five feet high. It would not be difficult
      to adduce similar instances; but I abstain, because the subject
      is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg393" id=
      "pg393">393</a></span> hardly refined enough for this immaculate
      period, this moral millenium of expurgated editions in books,
      manners, and royal trials of divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      This laudable delicacy&mdash;this crying-out elegance of the
      day&mdash;reminds me of a little circumstance which occurred when
      I was about eighteen years of age. There was then (and there may
      be still) a famous French "entremetteuse," who assisted young
      gentlemen in their youthful pastimes. We had been acquainted for
      some time, when something occurred in her line of business more
      than ordinary, and the refusal was offered to me (and doubtless
      to many others), probably because I was in cash at the moment,
      having taken up a decent sum from the Jews, and not having spent
      much above half of it. The adventure on the tapis, it seems,
      required some caution and circumspection. Whether my venerable
      friend doubted my politeness I cannot tell; but she sent me a
      letter couched in such English as a short residence of sixteen
      years in England had enabled her to acquire. After several
      precepts and instructions, the letter closed. But there was a
      postscript. It contained these words:&mdash;"Remember, Milor,
      that <i>delicaci ensure</i> everi succés." The <i>delicacy</i> of
      the day is exactly, in all its circumstances, like that of this
      respectable foreigner. "It ensures every <i>succès</i>," and is
      not a whit more moral than, and not half so honourable as, the
      coarser candour of our less polished ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to Mr. Bowles. "If what is here extracted can excite in
      the mind (I will not say of any 'layman', of any 'Christian',
      but) of any <i>human being</i>," &amp;c. &amp;c. Is not Mr.
      Gilchrist a "human being?" Mr. Bowles asks "whether in
      <i>attributing</i> an article," &amp;c. &amp;c, "to the critic,
      he had <i>any reason</i> for distinguishing him with that
      courtesy," &amp;c. &amp;c. But Mr. Bowles was wrong in
      "attributing the article" to Mr. Gilchrist at all; and would not
      have been right in calling him a dunce and a grocer, if he had
      written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles is here "peremptorily called upon to <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg394" id="pg394">394</a></span> speak of a
      circumstance which gives him the greatest pain,&mdash;the mention
      of a letter he received from the editor of 'The London
      Magazine.'" Mr. Bowles seems to have embroiled himself on all
      sides; whether by editing, or replying, or attributing, or
      quoting,&mdash;it has been an awkward affair for him.

      Poor Scott is now no more. In the exercise of his vocation, he
      contrived at last to make himself the subject of a coroner's
      inquest. But he died like a brave man, and he lived an able one.
      I knew him personally, though slightly. Although several years my
      senior, we had been schoolfellows together at the
      "grammar-schule" (or, as the Aberdonians pronounce it,
      "<i>squeel</i>") of New Aberdeen. He did not behave to me quite
      handsomely in his capacity of editor a few years ago, but he was
      under no obligation to behave otherwise. The moment was too
      tempting for many friends and for all enemies. At a time when all
      my relations (save one) fell from me like leaves from the tree in
      autumn winds, and my few friends became still fewer,&mdash;when
      the whole periodical press (I mean the daily and weekly,
      <i>not</i> the <i>literary</i> press) was let loose against me in
      every shape of reproach, with the two strange exceptions (from
      their usual opposition) of "The Courier" and "The
      Examiner,"&mdash;the paper of which Scott had the direction was
      neither the last nor the least vituperative. Two years ago I met
      him at Venice, when he was bowed in griefs by the loss of his
      son, and had known, by experience, the bitterness of domestic
      privation. He was then earnest with me to return to England; and
      on my telling him, with a smile, that he was once of a different
      opinion, he replied to me, 'that he and others had been greatly
      misled; and that some pains, and rather extraordinary means, had
      been taken to excite them.' Scott is no more, but there are more
      than one living who were present at this dialogue. He was a man
      of very considerable talents, and of great acquirements. He had
      made his way, as a literary character, with high success, and
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg395" id="pg395">395</a></span>
      in a few years. Poor fellow! I recollect his joy at some
      appointment which he had obtained, or was to obtain, through Sir
      James Mackintosh, and which prevented the further extension
      (unless by a rapid run to Rome) of his travels in Italy. I little
      thought to what it would conduct him. Peace be with
      him!&mdash;and may all such other faults as are inevitable to
      humanity be as readily forgiven him, as the little injury which
      he had done to one who respected his talents, and regrets his
      loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass over Mr. Bowles's page of explanation, upon the
      correspondence between him and Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;. It is of
      little importance in regard to Pope, and contains merely a
      re-contradiction of a contradiction of Mr. Gilchrist's. We now
      come to a point where Mr. Gilchrist has, certainly, rather
      exaggerated matters; and, of course, Mr. Bowles makes the most of
      it. Capital letters, like Kean's name, "large upon the bills,"
      are made use of six or seven times to express his sense of the
      outrage. The charge is, indeed, very boldly made; but, like
      "Ranold of the Mist's" practical joke of putting the bread and
      cheese into a dead man's mouth, is, as Dugald Dalgetty says,
      "somewhat too wild and salvage, besides wasting the good
      victuals."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gilchrist charges Mr. Bowles with "suggesting" that Pope
      "attempted" to commit "a rape" upon Lady M. Wortley Montague.
      There are two reasons why this could not be true. The first is,
      that like the chaste Letitia's prevention of the intended
      ravishment by Fireblood (in Jonathan Wild), it might have been
      impeded by a timely compliance. The second is, that however this
      might be, Pope was probably the less robust of the two; and (if
      the Lines on Sappho were really intended for this lady) the
      asserted consequences of her acquiescence in his wishes would
      have been a sufficient punishment. The passage which Mr. Bowles
      quotes, however, insinuates nothing of the kind: it merely
      charges her with encouragement, and him with wishing <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg396" id="pg396">396</a></span> to profit by
      it,&mdash;a slight attempt at seduction, and no more. The phrase
      is, "a step beyond decorum." Any physical violence is so
      abhorrent to human nature, that it recoils in cold blood from the
      very idea. But, the seduction of a woman's mind as well as person
      is not, perhaps, the least heinous sin of the two in morality.
      Dr. Johnson commends a gentleman who having seduced a girl who
      said, "I am afraid we have done wrong," replied, "Yes, we
      <i>have</i> done wrong,"&mdash;"for I would not <i>pervert</i>
      her mind also." Othello would not "kill Desdemona's <i>soul</i>."
      Mr. Bowles exculpates himself from Mr. Gilchrist's charge; but it
      is by substituting another charge against Pope. "A step beyond
      decorum," has a soft sound, but what does it express? In all
      these cases, "ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute." Has not the
      Scripture something upon "the lusting after a woman" being no
      less criminal than the crime? "A step beyond decorum," in short,
      any step beyond the instep, is a step from a precipice to the
      lady who permits it. For the gentleman who makes it it is also
      rather hazardous if he does not succeed, and still more so if he
      does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles appeals to the "Christian reader!" upon this
      "<i>Gilchristian</i> criticism." Is not this play upon such words
      "a step beyond decorum" in a clergyman? But I admit the
      temptation of a pun to be irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But "a hasty pamphlet was published, in which some personalities
      respecting Mr. Gilchrist were suffered to appear." If Mr. Bowles
      will write "hasty pamphlets," why is he so surprised on receiving
      short answers? The grand grievance to which he perpetually
      returns is a charge of "<i>hypochondriacism</i>," asserted or
      insinuated in the Quarterly. I cannot conceive a man in perfect
      health being much affected by such a charge, because his
      complexion and conduct must amply refute it. But were it true, to
      what does it amount?&mdash;to an impeachment of a liver
      complaint. "I will tell it to the world," exclaimed the learned
      Smelfungus.&mdash;"You had better," said I, "tell it to your
      physician." There is nothing <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg397" id="pg397">397</a></span> dishonourable in such a
      disorder, which is more peculiarly the malady of students. It has
      been the complaint of the good, and the wise, and the witty, and
      even of the gay. Regnard, the author of the last French comedy
      after Molière, was atrabilious; and Molière himself, saturnine.
      Dr. Johnson, Gray, and Burns, were all more or less affected by
      it occasionally. It was the prelude to the more awful malady of
      Collins, Cowper, Swift, and Smart; but it by no means follows
      that a partial affliction of this disorder is to terminate like
      theirs. But even were it so,&mdash;

        "Nor best, nor wisest, are exempt from thee;

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      If this be the criterion of exemption, Mr. Bowles's last two
      pamphlets form a better certificate of sanity than a physician's.
      Mendehlson and Bayle were at times so overcome with this
      depression, as to be obliged to recur to seeing "puppet-shows,
      and counting tiles upon the opposite houses," to divert
      themselves. Dr. Johnson at times "would have given a limb to
      recover his spirits." Mr. Bowles, who is (strange to say) fond of
      quoting Pope, may perhaps answer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Go on, obliging creatures, let me see
      </p>
      <p>
        All which disgrac'd my betters met in me."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      But the charge, such as it is, neither disgraces them nor him. It
      is easily disproved if false; and even if proved true, has
      nothing in it to make a man so very indignant. Mr. Bowles himself
      appears to be a little ashamed of his "hasty pamphlet;" for he
      attempts to excuse it by the "great provocation;" that is to say,
      by Mr. Bowles's supposing that Mr. Gilchrist was the writer of
      the article in the Quarterly, which he was <i>not</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, in extenuation, not only the <i>great</i> provocation
      should be remembered, but it ought to be said, that orders were
      sent to the London booksellers, that the most direct personal
      passages should be <i>omitted entirely</i>," <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg398" id="pg398">398</a></span> &amp;c. This
      is what the proverb calls "breaking a head and giving a plaster;"
      but, in this instance, the plaster was not spread in time, and
      Mr. Gilchrist does not seem at present disposed to regard Mr.
      Bowles's courtesies like the rust of the spear of Achilles, which
      had such "skill in surgery."
    </p>
    <p>
      But "Mr. Gilchrist has <i>no right</i> to object, as the reader
      will see." I am a reader, a "gentle reader," and I see nothing of
      the kind. Were I in Mr. Gilchrist's place, I should object
      exceedingly to being abused; firstly, for what I <i>did</i>
      write, and, secondly, for what I did <i>not</i> write; merely
      because it is Mr. Bowles's will and pleasure to be as angry with
      me for having written in the London Magazine, as for not having
      written in the Quarterly Review.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Gilchrist has had ample revenge; for he has, in his answer,
      said so and so," &amp;c. &amp;c. There is no great revenge in all
      this; and I presume that nobody either seeks or wishes it. What
      revenge? Mr. Bowles calls names, and he is answered. But Mr.
      Gilchrist and the Quarterly Reviewer are not poets, nor
      pretenders to poetry; therefore they can have no envy nor malice
      against Mr. Bowles: they have no acquaintance with Mr. Bowles,
      and can have no personal pique; they do not cross his path of
      life, nor he theirs. There is no political feud between them.
      What, then, can be the motive of their discussion of his deserts
      as an editor?&mdash;veneration for the genius of Pope, love for
      his memory, and regard for the classic glory of their country.
      Why would Mr. Bowles edite? Had he limited his honest endeavours
      to poetry, very little would have been said upon the subject, and
      nothing at all by his present antagonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles calls the pamphlet a "mud-cart," and the writer a
      "scavenger." Afterward he asks, "Shall he fling dirt and receive
      <i>rose-water</i>?" This metaphor, by the way, is taken from
      Marmontel's Memoirs; who, lamenting to Chamfort the shedding of
      blood during the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg399" id=
      "pg399">399</a></span> French revolution, was answered, "Do you
      think that revolutions are to be made with <i>rose-water</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I presume that "rose-water" would be infinitely
      more graceful in the hands of Mr. Bowles than the substance which
      he has substituted for that delicate liquid. It would also more
      confound his adversary, supposing him a "scavenger." I remember,
      (and do you remember, reader, that it was in my earliest youth,
      "Consule Planco,")&mdash;on the morning of the great battle, (the
      second)&mdash;between Gulley and Gregson,&mdash;<i>Cribb</i>, who
      was matched against Horton for the second fight, on the same
      memorable day, awaking me (a lodger at the inn in the next room)
      by a loud remonstrance to the waiter against the abomination of
      his towels, which had been laid in <i>lavender</i>. Cribb was a
      coal-heaver&mdash;and was much more discomfited by this
      odoriferous effeminacy of fine linen, than by his adversary
      Horton, whom, he "finished in style," though with some
      reluctance; for I recollect that he said, "he disliked hurting
      him, he looked so pretty,"&mdash;Horton being a very fine
      fresh-coloured young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to "rose-water"&mdash;that is, to gentle means of
      rebuke. Does Mr. Bowles know how to revenge himself upon a
      hackney-coachman, when he has overcharged his fare? In case he
      should not, I will tell him. It is of little use to call him "a
      rascal, a scoundrel, a thief, an impostor, a blackguard, a
      villain, a raggamuffin, a&mdash;what you please;" all that he is
      used to&mdash;it is his mother-tongue, and probably his mother's.
      But look him steadily and quietly in the face, and
      say&mdash;"Upon my word, I think you are the <i>ugliest
      fellow</i> I ever saw in my life," and he will instantly roll
      forth the brazen thunders of the charioteer Salmoneus as
      follows:&mdash;"<i>Hugly</i>! what the h&mdash;ll are <i>you</i>?
      <i>You</i> a <i>gentleman</i>! Why &mdash;&mdash;!" So much
      easier it is to <i>provoke</i>&mdash;and therefore to
      vindicate&mdash;(for passion punishes him who <i>feels</i> it
      more than those whom the passionate would excruciate)&mdash;by
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg400" id="pg400">400</a></span> a
      few quiet words the aggressor, than by retorting violently. The
      "coals of fire" of the Scripture are <i>benefits</i>;&mdash;but
      they are not the less "coals of <i>fire</i>."
    </p>

      Page 12. produces "more reasons,"&mdash;(the task ought not to
      have been difficult, for as yet there were none)&mdash;"to show
      why Mr. Bowles attributed the critique in the Quarterly to
      Octavius Gilchrist." All these "reasons" consist of
      <i>surmises</i> of Mr. Bowles, upon the presumed character of his
      opponent. "He did not suppose there could exist a man in the
      kingdom so <i>impudent</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. except Octavius
      Gilchrist."&mdash;"He did not think there was a man in the
      kingdom who would <i>pretend ignorance</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
      except Octavius Gilchrist."&mdash;"He did not conceive that one
      man in the kingdom would utter such stupid flippancy, &amp;c.
      &amp;c. except Octavius Gilchrist."&mdash;"He did not think there
      was one man in the kingdom who, &amp;c. &amp;c. could so utterly
      show his ignorance, <i>combined with conceit</i>, &amp;c. as
      Octavius Gilchrist."&mdash;"He did not believe there was a man in
      the kingdom so perfect in Mr. Gilchrist's 'old lunes,'" &amp;c.
      &amp;c.&mdash;"He did not think the <i>mean mind</i> of any one
      in the kingdom," &amp;c. and so on; always beginning with "any
      one in the kingdom," and ending with "Octavius Gilchrist," like
      the word in a catch. I am not "in the kingdom," and have not been
      much in the kingdom since I was one and twenty, (about five years
      in the whole, since I was of age,) and have no desire to be in
      the kingdom again, whilst I breathe, nor to sleep there
      afterwards; and I regret nothing more than having ever been "in
      the kingdom" at all. But though no longer a man "in the kingdom,"
      let me hope that when I have ceased to <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg401" id="pg401">401</a></span> exist, it may
      be said, as was answered by the master of Clanronald's henchman,
      his day after the battle of Sheriff-Muir, when he was found
      watching his chief's body. He was asked, "who that was?" he
      replied&mdash;"it was a man yesterday." And in this capacity, "in
      or out of the kingdom," I must own that I participate in many of
      the objections urged by Mr. Gilchrist. I participate in his love
      of Pope, and in his not understanding, and occasionally finding
      fault with, the last editor of our last truly great poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the reproaches against Mr. Gilchrist is, that he is (it is
      sneeringly said) an F. S. <i>A</i>. If it will give Mr. Bowles
      any pleasure, I am not an F. S. A. but a Fellow of the Royal
      Society at his service, in case there should be any thing in that
      association also which may point a paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are some other reasons," but "the author is now <i>not</i>
      unknown." Mr. Bowles has so totally exhausted himself upon
      Octavius Gilchrist, that he has not a word left for the real
      quarterer of his edition, although now "deterré."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following page refers to a mysterious charge of "duplicity,
      in regard to the publication of Pope's letters." Till this charge
      is made in proper form, we have nothing to do with it: Mr.
      Gilchrist hints it&mdash;Mr. Bowles denies it; there it rests for
      the present. Mr. Bowles professes his dislike to "Pope's
      duplicity, <i>not</i> to Pope"&mdash;a distinction apparently
      without a difference. However, I believe that I understand him.
      We have a great dislike to Mr. Bowles's edition of Pope, but
      <i>not</i> to Mr. Bowles; nevertheless, he takes up the subject
      as warmly as if it was personal. With regard to the fact of
      "Pope's duplicity," it remains to be proved&mdash;like Mr.
      Bowles's benevolence towards his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In page 14. we have a large assertion, that "the 'Eloisa' alone
      is sufficient to convict him of <i>gross licentiousness</i>."
      Thus, out it comes at last. Mr. Bowles <i>does</i> accuse Pope of
      "<i>gross</i> licentiousness," and grounds <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg402" id="pg402">402</a></span> the charge
      upon a poem. The <i>licentiousness</i> is a "grand peut-être,"
      according to the turn of the times being. The grossness I deny.
      On the contrary, I do believe that such a subject never was, nor
      ever could be, treated by any poet with so much delicacy, mingled
      with, at the same time, such true and intense passion. Is the
      "Atys" of Catullus <i>licentious</i>? No, nor even gross; and yet
      Catullus is often a coarse writer. The subject is nearly the
      same, except that Atys was the suicide of his manhood, and
      Abelard the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "licentiousness" of the story was <i>not</i> Pope's,&mdash;it
      was a fact. All that it had of gross, he has softened;&mdash;all
      that it had of indelicate, he has purified;&mdash;all that it had
      of passionate, he has beautified;&mdash;all that it had of holy,
      he has hallowed. Mr. Campbell has admirably marked this in a few
      words (I quote from memory), in drawing the distinction between
      Pope and Dryden, and pointing out where Dryden was wanting "I
      fear," says he, "that had the subject of 'Eloisa' fallen into his
      (Dryden's) hands, that he would have given us but a <i>coarse</i>
      draft of her passion." Never was the delicacy of Pope so much
      shown as in this poem. With the facts and the letters of "Eloisa"
      he has done what no other mind but that of the best and purest of
      poets could have accomplished with such materials. Ovid, Sappho
      (in the Ode called hers)&mdash;all that we have of ancient, all
      that we have of modern poetry, sinks into nothing compared with
      him in this production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us hear no more of this trash about "licentiousness." Is not
      "Anacreon" taught in our schools?&mdash;translated, praised, and
      edited? Are not his Odes the amatory praises of a boy? Is not
      Sappho's Ode on a girl? Is not this sublime and (according to
      Longinus) fierce love for one of her own sex? And is not
      Phillips's translation of it in the mouths of all your women? And
      are the English schools or the English women the more corrupt for
      all this? When you have thrown the ancients into the fire it will
      be time to denounce the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg403" id=
      "pg403">403</a></span> moderns. "Licentiousness!"&mdash;there is
      more real mischief and sapping licentiousness in a single French
      prose novel, in a Moravian hymn, or a German comedy, than in all
      the actual poetry that ever was penned, or poured forth, since
      the rhapsodies of Orpheus. The sentimental anatomy of Rousseau
      and Mad. de S. are far more formidable than any quantity of
      verse. They are so, because they sap the principles, by
      <i>reasoning</i> upon the <i>passions</i>; whereas poetry is in
      itself passion, and does not systematise. It assails, but does
      not argue; it may be wrong, but it does not assume pretensions to
      Optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles now has the goodness "to point out the difference
      between a <i>traducer</i> and him who sincerely states what he
      sincerely believes." He might have spared himself the trouble.
      The one is a liar, who lies knowingly; the other (I speak of a
      scandal-monger of course) lies, charitably believing that he
      speaks truth, and very sorry to find himself in
      falsehood;&mdash;because he
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Would rather that the dean should die,
      </p>
      <p>
        Than his prediction prove a lie."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      After a definition of a "traducer," which was quite superfluous
      (though it is agreeable to learn that Mr. Bowles so well
      understands the character), we are assured, that "he feels
      equally indifferent, Mr. Gilchrist, for what your malice can
      invent, or your impudence utter." This is indubitable; for it
      rests not only on Mr. Bowles's assurance, but on that of Sir
      Fretful Plagiary, and nearly in the same words,&mdash;"and I
      shall treat it with exactly the same calm indifference and
      philosophical contempt, and so your servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One thing has given Mr. Bowles concern." It is "a passage which
      might seem to reflect on the patronage a young man has received."
      MIGHT seem!! The passage alluded to expresses, that if Mr.
      Gilchrist be the reviewer of "a certain poet of nature," his
      praise <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg404" id=
      "pg404">404</a></span> and blame are equally
      contemptible."&mdash;Mr. Bowles, who has a peculiarly ambiguous
      style, where it suits him, comes off with a "<i>not</i> to the
      <i>poet</i>, but the critic," &amp;c. In my humble opinion, the
      passage referred to both. Had Mr. Bowles really meant fairly, he
      would have said so from the first&mdash;he would have been
      eagerly transparent.&mdash;"A certain poet of nature" is not the
      style of commendation. It is the very prologue to the most
      scandalous paragraphs of the newspapers, when
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "A certain high personage,"&mdash;"a certain peeress,"&mdash;"a
      certain illustrious foreigner,"&mdash;what do these words ever
      precede, but defamation? Had he felt a spark of kindling kindness
      for John Clare, he would have named him. There is a sneer in the
      sentence as it stands. How a favourable review of a deserving
      poet can "rather injure than promote his cause" is difficult to
      comprehend. The article denounced is able and amiable, and it
      <i>has</i> "served" the poet, as far as poetry can be served by
      judicious and honest criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the two next paragraphs of Mr. Bowles's pamphlet it is
      pleasing to concur. His mention of "Pennie," and his former
      patronage of "Shoel," do him honour. I am not of those who may
      deny Mr. Bowles to be a benevolent man. I merely assert, that he
      is not a candid editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles has been "a writer occasionally upwards of thirty
      years," and never wrote one word in reply in his life "to
      criticisms, merely <i>as</i> criticisms." This is Mr. Lofty in
      Goldsmith's Good-natured Man; "and I vow by all that's
      honourable, my resentment has never done the men, as mere men,
      any manner of harm,&mdash;that is, <i>as mere men</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letter to the editor of the newspaper" is owned; but "it was
      not on account of the criticism. It was because the criticism
      came down in a frank <i>directed</i> to Mrs.
      Bowles!!!"&mdash;(the italics and three <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg405" id="pg405">405</a></span> notes of
      admiration appended to Mrs. Bowles are copied verbatim from the
      quotation), and Mr. Bowles was not displeased with the criticism,
      but with the frank and the address. I agree with Mr. Bowles that
      the intention was to annoy him; but I fear that this was answered
      by his notice of the reception of the criticism. An anonymous
      letter-writer has but one means of knowing the effect of his
      attack. In this he has the superiority over the viper; he knows
      that his poison has taken effect, when he hears the victim
      cry;&mdash;the adder is <i>deaf</i>. The best reply to an
      anonymous intimation is to take no notice directly nor
      indirectly. I wish Mr. Bowles could see only one or two of the
      thousand which I have received in the course of a literary life,
      which, though begun early, has not yet extended to a third part
      of his existence as an author. I speak of <i>literary</i> life
      only. Were I to add <i>personal</i>, I might double the amount of
      <i>anonymous</i> letters. If he could but see the violence, the
      threats, the absurdity of the whole thing, he would laugh, and so
      should I, and thus be both gainers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep up the farce,&mdash;within the last month of this present
      writing (1821), I have had my life threatened in the same way
      which menaced Mr. Bowles's fame,&mdash;excepting that the
      anonymous denunciation was addressed to the Cardinal Legate of
      Romagna, instead of to Mrs. Bowles. The Cardinal is, I believe,
      the elder lady of the two. I append the menace in all its
      barbaric but literal Italian, that Mr. Bowles may be convinced;
      and as this is the only "promise to pay," which the Italians ever
      keep, so my person has been at least as much exposed to a "shot
      in the gloaming," from "John Heatherblutter" (see Waverley), as
      ever Mr. Bowles's glory was from an editor. I am, nevertheless,
      on horseback and lonely for some hours (<i>one</i> of them
      twilight) in the forest daily; and this, because it was my
      "custom in the afternoon," and that I believe if the tyrant
      cannot escape amidst his guards (should it be <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg406" id="pg406">406</a></span> so written?),
      so the humbler individual would find precautions useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles has here the humility to say, that "he must succumb;
      for with Lord Byron turned against him, he has no
      chance,"&mdash;a declaration of self-denial not much in unison
      with his "promise," five lines afterwards, that "for every
      twenty-four lines quoted by Mr. Gilchrist, or his friend, to
      greet him with as many from the 'Gilchrisiad';" but so much the
      better. Mr. Bowles has no reason to "succumb" but to Mr. Bowles.
      As a poet, the author of "The Missionary" may compete with the
      foremost of his cotemporaries. Let it be recollected, that all my
      previous opinions of Mr. Bowles's poetry were <i>written</i> long
      before the publication of his last and best poem; and that a
      poet's <i>last</i> poem should be his best, is his highest
      praise. But, however, he may duly and honourably rank with his
      living rivals. There never was so complete a proof of the
      superiority of Pope, as in the lines with which Mr. Bowles closes
      his "<i>to be concluded in our next</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles is avowedly the champion and the poet of nature. Art
      and the arts are dragged, some before, and others behind his
      chariot. Pope, where he deals with passion, and with the nature
      of the naturals of the day, is allowed even by themselves to be
      sublime; but they complain that too soon&mdash;

      and <i>there</i> even <i>they</i> allow him to be unrivalled. He
      has succeeded, and even surpassed them, when he chose, in their
      own <i>pretended</i> province. Let us see what their Coryphæus
      effects in Pope's. But it is too pitiable, it is too melancholy,
      to see Mr. Bowles "<i>sinning</i>" not "<i>up</i>" but
      "<i>down</i>" as a poet to his lowest depth as an editor. By the
      way, Mr. Bowles is always quoting Pope. I grant that there is no
      poet&mdash;not Shakspeare himself&mdash;who can be so often
      quoted, with reference to life;&mdash;but his editor is so like
      the devil quoting Scripture, <span class="pagenum"><a name=

      his proper place, quoting in the pulpit.

    <p>
      And now for his lines. But it is painful&mdash;painful&mdash;to
      see such a suicide, though at the shrine of Pope. I can't copy

        "The assassin's vengeance, and the coward's lie."
      </p>

    <p>
      And Mr. Bowles persists that he is a well-wisher to Pope!!! He
      has, then, edited an "assassin" and a <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg408" id="pg408">408</a></span> "coward"
      wittingly, as well as lovingly. In my former letter I have
      remarked upon the editor's forgetfulness of Pope's benevolence.
      But where he mentions his faults it is "with sorrow"&mdash;his
      tears drop, but they do not blot them out. The "recording angel"
      differs from the recording clergyman. A fulsome editor is
      pardonable though tiresome, like a panegyrical son whose pious
      sincerity would demi-deify his father. But a detracting editor is
      a paricide. He sins against the nature of his office, and
      connection&mdash;he murders the life to come of his victim. If
      his author is not worthy to be mentioned, do not edit at all: if
      he be, edit honestly, and even flatteringly. The reader will
      forgive the weakness in favour of mortality, and correct your
      adulation with a smile. But to sit down "mingere in patrios
      cineres," as Mr. Bowles has done, merits a reprobation so strong,
      that I am as incapable of expressing as of ceasing to feel it.
    </p>
    <h4>
      <i>Further Addenda</i>.
    </h4>
    <p>
      It is worthy of remark that, after all this outcry about
      "<i>in-door</i> nature" and "artificial images," Pope was the
      principal inventor of that boast of the English, <i>Modern
      Gardening</i>. He divides this honour with Milton. Hear
      Warton:&mdash;"It hence appears, that this <i>enchanting</i> art
      of modern gardening, in which this kingdom claims a preference
      over every nation in Europe, chiefly owes <i>its origin</i> and
      its improvements to two great poets, Milton and <i>Pope</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Walpole (no friend to Pope) asserts that Pope formed
      <i>Kent's</i> taste, and that Kent was the artist to whom the
      English are chiefly indebted for diffusing "a taste in laying out
      grounds." The design of the Prince of Wales's garden was copied
      from <i>Pope's</i> at Twickenham. Warton applauds "his singular
      effort of art and taste, in impressing so much variety and
      scenery on a spot of five acres." Pope was the <i>first</i> who
      ridiculed the "formal, French, Dutch, false and unnatural taste
      in gardening," <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg409" id=
      "pg409">409</a></span> both in <i>prose</i> and verse. (See, for
      the former, "The Guardian.")
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pope has given not only some of our <i>first</i> but <i>best</i>
      rules and observations on <i>Architecture</i> and
      <i>Gardening</i>." (See Warton's Essay, vol. ii. p. 237, &amp;c.
      &amp;c.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, is it not a shame, after this, to hear our Lakers in "Kendal
      Green," and our Bucolical Cockneys, crying out (the latter in a
      wilderness of bricks and mortar) about "Nature," and Pope's
      "artificial in-door habits?" Pope had seen all of nature that
      <i>England</i> alone can supply. He was bred in Windsor Forest,
      and amidst the beautiful scenery of Eton; he lived familiarly and
      frequently at the country seats of Bathurst, Cobham, Burlington,
      Peterborough, Digby, and Bolingbroke; amongst whose seats was to
      be numbered <i>Stowe</i>. He made his own little "five acres" a
      model to princes, and to the first of our artists who imitated
      nature. Warton thinks "that the most engaging of <i>Kent</i>'s
      works was also planned on the model of Pope's,&mdash;at least in
      the opening and retiring shades of Venus's Vale."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that Pope was infirm and deformed; but he could walk,
      and he could ride (he rode to Oxford from London at a stretch),
      and he was famous for an exquisite eye. On a tree at Lord
      Bathurst's is carved "Here Pope sang,"&mdash;he composed beneath
      it. Bolingbroke, in one of his letters, represents them both
      writing in the hay-field. No poet ever admired Nature more, or
      used her better, than Pope has done, as I will undertake to prove
      from his works, <i>prose</i> and <i>verse</i>, if not anticipated
      in so easy and agreeable a labour. I remember a passage in
      Walpole, somewhere, of a gentleman who wished to give directions
      about some willows to a man who had long served Pope in his
      grounds: "I understand, sir," he replied: "you would have them
      hang down, sir, <i>somewhat poetical</i>." Now, if nothing
      existed but this little anecdote, it would suffice to prove
      Pope's taste for <i>Nature</i>, and the impression which he had
      made on a common-minded man. But I have already quoted Warton and
      Walpole (<i>both</i> his enemies), <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg410" id="pg410">410</a></span> and, were it necessary, I could
      amply quote Pope himself for such tributes to <i>Nature</i> as no
      poet of the present day has even approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      His various excellence is really wonderful: architecture,
      painting, <i>gardening</i>, all are alike subject to his genius.
      Be it remembered, that English <i>gardening</i> is the purposed
      perfectioning of niggard <i>Nature</i>, and that without it
      England is but a hedge-and-ditch, double-post-and-rail, Hounslow
      Heath and Clapham Common sort of country, since the principal
      forests have been felled. It is, in general, far from a
      picturesque country. The case is different with Scotland, Wales,
      and Ireland; and I except also the lake counties and Derbyshire,
      together with Eton, Windsor, and my own dear Harrow on the Hill,
      and some spots near the coast. In the present rank fertility of
      "great poets of the age," and "schools of poetry"&mdash;a word
      which, like "schools of eloquence" and of "philosophy," is never
      introduced till the decay of the art has increased with the
      number of its professors&mdash;in the present day, then, there
      have sprung up two sorts of Naturals;&mdash;the Lakers, who whine
      about Nature because they live in Cumberland; and their
      <i>under-sect</i> (which some one has maliciously called the
      "Cockney School"), who are enthusiastical for the country because
      they live in London. It is to be observed, that the rustical
      founders are rather anxious to disclaim any connexion with their
      metropolitan followers, whom they ungraciously review, and call
      cockneys, atheists, foolish fellows, bad writers, and other hard
      names not less ungrateful than unjust. I can understand the
      pretensions of the aquatic gentlemen of Windermere to what Mr.
      Braham terms "<i>entusumusy</i>," for lakes, and mountains, and
      daffodils, and buttercups; but I should be glad to be apprised of
      the foundation of the London propensities of their imitative
      brethren to the same "high argument." Southey, Wordsworth, and
      Coleridge have rambled over half Europe, and seen Nature in most
      of her varieties (although I think that they have occasionally
      not used her very well); but what on <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg411" id="pg411">411</a></span>
      earth&mdash;of earth, and sea, and Nature&mdash;have the others
      seen? Not a half, nor a tenth part so much as Pope. While they
      sneer at his Windsor Forest, have they ever seen any thing of
      Windsor except its <i>brick</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      The most rural of these gentlemen is my friend Leigh Hunt, who
      lives at Hampstead. I believe that I need not disclaim any
      personal or poetical hostility against that gentleman. A more
      amiable man in society I know not; nor (when he will allow his
      sense to prevail over his sectarian principles) a better writer.
      When he was writing his "Rimini," I was not the last to discover
      its beauties, long before it was published. Even then I
      remonstrated against its vulgarisms; which are the more
      extraordinary, because the author is any thing but a vulgar man.
      Mr. Hunt's answer was, that he wrote them upon principle; they
      made part of his "<i>system!!</i>" I then said no more. When a
      man talks of his system, it is like a woman's talking of her
      <i>virtue</i>. I let them talk on. Whether there are writers who
      could have written "Rimini," as it might have been written, I
      know not; but Mr. Hunt is, probably, the only poet who could have
      had the heart to spoil his own Capo d'Opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the rest of his young people I have no acquaintance, except
      through some things of theirs (which have been sent out without
      my desire), and I confess that till I had read them I was not
      aware of the full extent of human absurdity. Like Garrick's "Ode
      to Shakspeare," <i>they "defy criticism</i>." These are of the
      personages who decry Pope. One of them, a Mr. John Ketch, has
      written some lines against him, of which it were better to be the
      subject than the author. Mr. Hunt redeems himself by occasional
      beauties; but the rest of these poor creatures seem so far gone
      that I would not "march through Coventry with them, that's flat!"
      were I in Mr. Hunt's place. To be sure, he has "led his
      ragamuffins where they will be well peppered;" but a system-maker
      must receive all sorts of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg412"
      id="pg412">412</a></span> proselytes. When they have really seen
      life&mdash;when they have felt it&mdash;when they have travelled
      beyond the far distant boundaries of the wilds of
      Middlesex&mdash;when they have overpassed the Alps of Highgate,
      and traced to its sources the Nile of the New River&mdash;then,
      and not till then, can it properly he permitted to them to
      despise Pope; who had, if not <i>in Wales</i>, been <i>near</i>
      it, when he described so beautifully the "<i>artificial</i>"
      works of the Benefactor of Nature and mankind, the "Man of Ross,"
      whose picture, still suspended in the parlour of the inn, I have
      so often contemplated with reverence for his memory, and
      admiration of the poet, without whom even his own still existing
      good works could hardly have preserved his honest renown.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also observe to my friend Hunt, that I shall be very glad
      to see him at Ravenna, not only for my sincere pleasure in his
      company, and the advantage which a thousand miles or so of travel
      might produce to a "natural" poet, but also to point out one or
      two little things in "Rimini," which he probably would not have
      placed in his opening to that poem, if he had ever seen
      Ravenna;&mdash;unless, indeed, it made "part of his system!!" I
      must also crave his indulgence for having spoken of his
      disciples&mdash;by no means an agreeable or self-sought subject.
      If they had said nothing of <i>Pope</i>, they might have remained
      "alone with their glory" for aught I should have said or thought
      about them or their nonsense. But if they interfere with the
      "little Nightingale" of Twickenham, they may find others who will
      bear it&mdash;<i>I</i> won't. Neither time, nor distance, nor
      grief, nor age, can ever diminish my veneration for him, who is
      the great moral poet of all times, of all climes, of all
      feelings, and of all stages of existence. The delight of my
      boyhood, the study of my manhood, perhaps (if allowed to me to
      attain it) he may be the consolation of my age. His poetry is the
      Book of Life. Without canting, and yet without neglecting
      religion, he has assembled all that a <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg413" id="pg413">413</a></span> good and
      great man can gather together of moral wisdom clothed in
      consummate beauty. Sir William Temple observes, "that of all the
      members of mankind that live within the compass of a thousand
      years, for one man that is born capable of making a <i>great
      poet</i>, there may be a <i>thousand</i> born capable of making
      as great generals and ministers of state as any in story." Here
      is a statesman's opinion of poetry: it is honourable to him and
      to the art. Such a "poet of a thousand years" was <i>Pope</i>. A
      thousand years will roll away before such another can be hoped
      for in our literature. But it can <i>want</i> them&mdash;he
      himself is a literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word upon his so brutally abused translation of Homer. "Dr.
      Clarke, whose critical exactness is well known, has <i>not
      been</i> able to point out above three or four mistakes <i>in the
      sense</i> through the whole Iliad. The real faults of the
      translation are of a different kind." So says Warton, himself a
      scholar. It appears by this, then, that he avoided the chief
      fault of a translator. As to its other faults, they consist in
      his having made a beautiful English poem of a sublime Greek one.
      It will always hold. Cowper and all the rest of the blank
      pretenders may do their best and their worst: they will never
      wrench Pope from the hands of a single reader of sense and
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grand distinction of the under forms of the new school of
      poets is their <i>vulgarity</i>. By this I do not mean that they
      are <i>coarse</i>, but "shabby-genteel," as it is termed. A man
      may be <i>coarse</i> and yet not <i>vulgar</i>, and the reverse.
      Burns is often coarse, but never <i>vulgar</i>. Chatterton is
      never vulgar, nor Wordsworth, nor the higher of the Lake school,
      though they treat of low life in all its branches. It is in their
      <i>finery</i> that the new under school are <i>most</i> vulgar,
      and they may be known by this at once; as what we called at
      Harrow "a Sunday blood" might be easily distinguished from a
      gentleman, although his clothes might be the better cut, and his
      boots the best blackened, of the two;&mdash;probably because
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg414" id="pg414">414</a></span>
      he made the one, or cleaned the other, with his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present case, I speak of writing, not of persons. Of the
      latter, I know nothing; of the former, I judge as it is found. Of
      my friend Hunt, I have already said, that he is any thing but
      vulgar in his manners; and of his disciples, therefore, I will
      not judge of their manners from their verses. They may be
      honourable and <i>gentlemanly</i> men, for what I know; but the
      latter quality is studiously excluded from their publications.
      They remind me of Mr. Smith and the Miss Broughtons at the
      Hampstead Assembly, in "Evelina." In these things (in private
      life, at least,) I pretend to some small experience; because, in
      the course of my youth, I have seen a little of all sorts of
      society, from the Christian prince and the Mussulman sultan and
      pacha, and the higher ranks of their countries, down to the
      London boxer, the "<i>flash and the swell</i>," the Spanish
      muleteer, the wandering Turkish dervise, the Scotch highlander,
      and the Albanian robber;&mdash;to say nothing of the curious
      varieties of Italian social life. Far be it from me to presume
      that there ever was, or can be, such a thing as an
      <i>aristocracy</i> of <i>poets</i>; but there <i>is</i> a
      nobility of thought and of style, open to all stations, and
      derived partly from talent, and partly from
      education,&mdash;which is to be found in Shakspeare, and Pope,
      and Burns, no less than in Dante and Alfieri, but which is
      nowhere to be perceived in the mock birds and bards of Mr. Hunt's
      little chorus. If I were asked to define what this
      gentlemanliness is, I should say that it is only to be defined by
      <i>examples</i>&mdash;of those who have it, and those who have it
      not. In <i>life</i>, I should say that most <i>military</i> men
      have it, and few <i>naval</i>;&mdash;that several men of rank
      have it, and few lawyers;&mdash;that it is more frequent among
      authors than divines (when they are not pedants); that
      <i>fencing</i>-masters have more of it than dancing-masters, and
      singers than players; and that (if it be not an Irishism to say
      so) it is far <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg415" id=
      "pg415">415</a></span> more generally diffused among women than
      among men. In poetry, as well as writing in general, it will
      never <i>make</i> entirely a poet or a poem; but neither poet nor
      poem will ever be good for any thing without it. It is the
      <i>salt</i> of society, and the seasoning of composition.
      <i>Vulgarity</i> is far worse than downright
      <i>blackguardism</i>; for the latter comprehends wit, humour, and
      strong sense at times; while the former is a sad abortive attempt
      at all things, "signifying nothing." It does not depend upon low
      themes, or even low language, for Fielding revels in
      both;&mdash;but is he ever <i>vulgar</i>? No. You see the man of
      education, the gentleman, and the scholar, sporting with his
      subject,&mdash;its master, not its slave. Your vulgar writer is
      always most vulgar, the higher, his subject; as the man who
      showed the menagerie at Pidcock's was wont to say,&mdash;"This,
      gentlemen, is the <i>eagle</i> of the <i>sun</i>, from Archangel,
      in Russia; the <i>otterer</i> it is, the <i>igherer</i> he
      flies." But to the proofs. It is a thing to be felt more than
      explained. Let any man take up a volume of Mr. Hunt's subordinate
      writers, read (if possible) a couple of pages, and pronounce for
      himself, if they contain not the kind of writing which may be
      likened to "shabby-genteel" in actual life. When he has done
      this, let him take up Pope;&mdash;and when he has laid him down,
      take up the cockney again&mdash;if he can.

        Montague was also greatly to blame in that quarrel, <i>not</i>
        for having rejected, but for having encouraged him: but I would

        There, Mr. Bowles!&mdash;what say you to such a supper with
        such a woman? and her own description too? Is not her
        "<i>champaigne and chicken</i>" worth a forest or two? Is it
        not poetry? It appears to me that this stanza contains the
        "<i>purée</i>" of the whole philosophy of Epicurus:&mdash;I
        mean the <i>practical</i> philosophy of his school, not the
        precepts of the master; for I have been too long at the
        university not to know that the philosopher was himself a
        moderate man. But, after all, would not some of us have been as
        great fools as Pope? For my part, I wonder that, with his quick
        feelings, her coquetry, and his disappointment, he did no
        more,&mdash;instead of writing some lines, which are to be
        condemned if false, and regretted if true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="pg417" id=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
